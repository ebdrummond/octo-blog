I'm not the happiest with middleman and want to address a few challenges, so I'm creating a blog from scratch with Rails, hopefully without needing to reference the Blogger tutorial at all.

My challenges:

1. Create an attractive design to practice front end development and showcase a blog I can be proud to show off - I really don't like the current look of my blog, and especially as I'm increasingly going to be showing it off to potential employers, I need to stand behind and be proud of my work.
2. Practice my Rails skills from soup to nuts.  I love working on teams, but it necessitates touching only part of the code.  This will be good practice for me to make sure I understand the process beginning to end, and it's great practice before our individual project in two weeks!
3. Most importantly, 100% of the code will be written in TDD.  Literally not one line of code will be written without a failing test.  I haven't always been the best about adhering to strict TDD, and I need to get better - I know firsthand why it's important, and no skill is going to magically appear; I need to practice it.

So... wish me luck!  Hopefully you'll see a finished product I'm proud to stand by in no time :)  The biggest challenge I'm anticipating is just finding time to work on it with all the other projects I'm working on, but honestly, since there's no firm deadline and I am going at my own pace, working on it so far has almost felt like a break from everything else.  It is a good feeling - programming can be tough, but even just the small amount of time I've put in so far reminds me of how much I love to do it.
