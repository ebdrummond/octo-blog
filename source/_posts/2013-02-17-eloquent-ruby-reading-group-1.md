Before picking up Eloquent Ruby, I had used symbols in my code numerous times, but never really understood why it was I was using them.  I had them explained to me a few different places, but why I was using them was still a little difficult for me to master.  After the chapter on symbols, I'm not sure I'll still jump to the knowing exactly when would be the best time to use a symbol, but the way the information was presented in the book, I feel like when I am led to use them now, I will understand why I'm doing so - I'm using 'the eyes peering out from the tilted head of a confused but friendly dog' because I want the symbol to be a constant in a way that a string is not.

A large part of the Eloquent Ruby book so far has been an interesting read, but a lot of the information hasn't sunk in deep enough for me to have had an 'a-ha!' moment with what's being taught.  One of the areas this is especially true is regular expressions.  Again, regular expressions have been explained to me a few different ways, but (especially as I haven't used them very much in my code yet), their usage hasn't clicked with me yet.  I have found this book to be very accessible though, even if I haven't quite mastered all the concepts presented, so that I'm hoping it will be easy to dive back in a re-introduce myself once I'm further along in my journey and ready to let some more 'a-ha' moments sink in.

One area presented in the book that is really emphasizing what I'm learning outside of the book is the insistence on test coverage for your code, which I'm learning through our Sales Engine project is really helpful.  When we first covered testing, I was most excited about it given that it forces you to write tiny little chunks of code at a time instead of feeling like you have to break off a huge class or relationship, which may or may not work in the end.  During Sales Engine, I've discovered this to be true, but have also found a few instances where I've been able to quickly address flaws in my logic through testing instead of forging on and discovering the mess later, when other relationships may have been built on my flawed logic.

I'm also noticing concepts addressed in the book that I have not learned about yet - sub and superclasses, dynamic typing versus static type checking, etc.  While my main focus right now is on finishing Sales Engine, I've created a list of these topics that I'd like to dig more deeply into in some free time, so I have more background on them when these do come up.  The sub and superclass idea especially is interesting to me - I didn't know that classes could inherit methods from other classes.  It will be interesting to see how I interact with the information presented in the book in a second pass through later on once I have a better grasp of these concepts.  As much as I learned this time, I think it will be even more useful next time with a little more knowledge and experience under my belt.
