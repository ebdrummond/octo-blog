#####Ingredients
* 1 heaping tsp coconut oil*
* 1 1/2 tsp protein powder**
* 1 1/2 heaping cups frozen fruit
* Rice milk

Go nuts with what kinds of fruit you want and try different pairings.  Peaches, mangoes, berries, cherries... it's all good.

#####Instructions
Put coconut oil, protein powder, and fruit in a blender (I prefer to use an immersion blender in a sturdy mixing beaker).  Pour in rice milk until it fills in the cracks between pieces of fruit.  Blend.  Enjoy.

\* Just in case I am not the only one who didn't realize what coconut oil was - it's not a liquid, it's a solid.<br>
