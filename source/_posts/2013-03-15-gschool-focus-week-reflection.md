I really enjoyed this focus week and the chance to catch my breath and review what I've learned so far.  I started the week, quite frankly, pretty surprised with the group I was in - I thought for sure I would be in the refresher group, but I was placed in the intermediate group, where we worked on re-doing Sales Engine in the context of a web app.  It was honestly really helpful for me to be able to re-do an old project with the knowledge that I now have.  When I first did Sales Engine, it was a struggle for me, the code I wrote felt very awkward, and some of what Jeff/Raphael helped us with for code creation and refactoring was still really fuzzy in my mind.  This go around, I felt more confident I understood the concepts, and the code felt a lot more natural to me.  I also focused much more intensively on testing, which I think helped to instill confidence in my code as I was writing it, and helped me to catch bugs early on.

In fact, I made a really dumb mistake in my code - to create new object instances between classes, I used each instead of collect, which gave me all the information I needed... as hashes, not as objects.  I noticed my code wasn't working the way I wanted it to, and quickly discovered it was broken, leading me to (with Laura's help) find my mistake.  If I hadn't been testing as intensively as I was, I don't know that I would have found it as quickly.

Even though the focus week is formally over, I'm not done with this project and I'd like to keep working on it, if for nothing else than to prove to myself that I can do this.  I know I've really struggled with self-confidence during this course so far, but I feel like I'm turning a corner and the ability to keep up with this project relatively well has been a big boost for me.  That, and when I have a problem I can't work out or a project that's not complete, my brain doesn't want to let it go.  I want to keep working on it til it's done and I can see everything working.  I still feel a kind of rush when I see my code working, similar to that first tingling I felt all the way back at LivingSocial when I went to the intro to programming workshop.  While I do sometimes still feel some anxiety that I'm not learning quickly enough, I still really like what I'm doing.  I can't wait to see what I can do once this program is over.  I never would have thought I'd have learned all that I know now in such a short period of time.

I've just scratched the surface on this, but I'm really interested in learning more about controllers and the MVC model.  I understand as a concept what the controller does, but I'm still not clear on how to execute everything in my code.  For this project, for example, where do I validate that a link someone has requested exists?  In the controller, in the router?  I have been trying to finish up the business intelligence component since I still want to become more confident in objects interacting, but once that piece is complete I'd like to play around with the controller model Jeff showed us and see if I can figure out some answers.

One area I still feel shaky on is starting a project.  For this one, I was really glad Jeff started it with us, and helped to guide us in the right direction.  Even though I knew Sales Engine at this point and what it did, starting out on my own would have been difficult.  If there's one thing at the top of my agenda going forward, it's to get better at deconstructing spec requirements better so that I don't feel quite so overwhelmed and have a clear idea on how/where to start a new project.

Overall, I'm really glad that the calendar was modified for this focus week.  It was really helpful to me and to a lot of other people I've talked to.  I don't know if it's feasible, but I'd love to have another one later on in the course if we reach another point where a lot of people are feeling really behind... although I hope this week has helped enough so that we don't feel as behind anymore!
