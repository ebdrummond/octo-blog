First class week of Traffic Spy is on the books.  This has been a really difficult assignment for me.  I think I understand how each of the individual pieces (Sinatra, databases, Ruby) work individually, but when I try to put them together, my brain just freezes up.  It's been hard to start, but I'm really glad my partner and I spent a good amount of time upfront conceptualizing how the pieces of the project would fit together instead of feeling we had to rush into code.  I've found that even though we do have a good idea of how the pieces fit, starting the coding has been difficult - we'll get one piece in, and then feel really confused about how to take a next step.  We're also getting really conflicting advice when we ask for help, but I think we've done relatively well at not spinning our wheels too much, picking a direction, and going for it.  I know this will eventually sink in, but I'm not there yet.  I feel really lucky to have a partner that's been really understanding, but I feel I haven't personally contributed very much brain power to this project.

I reached out this week to a Hungry Academy alumnus that I had heard struggled through the course to get his perspective on what I can do to keep up and absorb as much as I can.  His advice was to keep studying and ask a ton of questions, but he felt behind for most of the program as well and is only now feeling comfortable with Ruby and Rails.  I've definitely gotten more comfortable asking questions, but I still feel like I want to do my best to try to work through all these new ideas before I ask questions to see if I can work through it on my own - I try to look up ideas and let the learning sink in before asking questions, but when we have a limited amount of time to complete a project, I'm not sure the best approach.  I also sometimes feel like I don't even know how to formulate a question to get a meaningful answer on what I don't know.  I do wish there was more opportunity for small groups of people who are feeling a little behind like me to work through some of these new ideas with the instructors in a structured environment.

Overall I'm really trying to focus on Do I know more today than I did yesterday, and the answer every day is yes.  I'm trying to keep this foremost in my mind as I keep working through projects and learning new systems.  I know it's going to get better and that it's unrealistic that I'm going to have mastered every single thing we're exposed to in gSchool by the time we graduate.  Still, I am looking forward to making better sense of how to get tools like Sinatra, databases, and my base Ruby knowledge to interact - this is really a lot more exciting to me conceptually than what we've been doing, but it's also a lot more difficult to sort out.

I am also pretty nervous about our skills evaluation.  I have learned a tremendous amount in such a short timespan, but because there's so much new information in my head, it gets jumbled up and I haven't been able to absorb everything I've learned.  I am looking forward to seeing an objective assessment of where I am though so I know what to concentrate on studying.
