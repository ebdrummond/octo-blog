There's a lot of times it's been stressful and it's so easy to get completely discouraged - when there's those damned RSpec errors that will not go away no matter what you do, or when you are just plain not getting what's going on.  But the feeling you get when you finally figure something out - whether it's an a-ha! moment or just a technical issue you've been struggling with for a while - that's what makes it worth it.  I need to keep this feeling in my back pocket for those stressful times and remind myself the confetti will rain again.
