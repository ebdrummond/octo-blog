I haven't been updating this as much as I should be, but wanted to post an update on my last month of gSchool and what's been going on since it's over.

My last month of gSchool was pretty hectic with job searching.  I really wanted to take my time to interview with a variety of companies, and find the place that was the best fit for my top two priorities: firstly, I wanted to find a place that was a good fit for me culturally, where I liked the people I was working with, and looked forward to coming in and working with them every day, and where their values were consistent with my own.  Secondly, it was imperative that I work with a company where I could continue to learn, and that would nurture my ongoing learning process.

I didn't want to just take the first thing that came along, so I really took the time to get to know a number of companies to find the best one for me.  This meant a lot of phone interviews, skype interviews, in person interviews, and take home coding challenges.  I felt pretty bad, because given how busy I was with the interview process, I wasn't able to put in the time that I wanted to on my group projects.  Everyone understood though; everyone else was doing the same.

At the end of it, I came away with three job offers from wonderful companies, any of which I could see myself enjoying culturally, and where I would learn a ton from awesome co-workers and interesting projects.  It was especially difficult as the offers were all from my top three cities - Chicago, Portland, and Denver.  In the end, I decided to accept the offer as a software developer with [Table XI](http://www.tablexi.com) in Chicago, for a few reasons:

* I love Chicago.  It's an amazing city, with a ton to do.  I've always considered myself a city person, and I am really excited to get back to a large city with a ton of cultural options, great public transit, people from all over the world - all in America's third largest city.  It helps a lot too that even though it's a huge city, it's still the Midwest, so people are incredibly nice there.  Also the cost of living, especially compared to DC, is great.  Also I have a bunch of friends from college there.  Also the food there is incredible.  Really, just a lot of alsos.
* I'm back within driving distance of my family, which I haven't been since college.  Speaking of college, I'm also within driving distance of East Lansing, so I can go back home and catch some Spartan football and basketball games!  Go Green!
* Most importantly, I felt that Table XI was the very best fit for me personally.  There are so many things that I love about them, and throughout the interview process, there were a hundred little moments where I just knew this was where I was supposed to be.  The people are all amazingly smart, excited about the work they're doing, happy to help, and yet humble and super nice.  It's a consultancy, so there's a bunch of different projects they get to work on.  They do a lot of work with community groups and non-profits, which is a great fit for my social relations background - even though I'm not saving the world full time anymore, it's still one of my values.  The people stay there long term because they genuinely love working there.  There's about ten more pages worth of things I could say about how great Table XI is, but long story short - I'm unbelievably excited to start working there and am so thankful I have this opportunity.

The actual end of gSchool has been bittersweet.  On one hand, I'm happy the madness is over and excited to be moving on to my new job, but on the other, I really miss working with all my classmates - they were amazing people and I made some good friends there.  We had a big party the last day, both at Galvanize and later on at Chris's house, and it was so good to let everything out and spend one last (quite memorable) night with everyone, but I also realized this is likely the last time we were all going to be together.

Since gSchool ended, it's still been a whirlwind.  We started looking into relocating to Chicago, I flew out to Chicago to find an apartment (success!  We'll be living in West Lakeview), we visited our friends in Chile (separate post forthcoming), and now I'm trying to cram in all the Denver things I didn't have time to do during gSchool, and meeting up with all my friends here one last time before I leave.  On top of that, I need to pick my sister's New Leaf Massage site back up, and have some books I want to read before starting with Table XI, so this is definitely not a lazy vacation for me!  I did get some reprieve on New Leaf though - my sister just found out she's relocating to Phoenix for her husband's job, and it takes about six months to get set up as a massage therapist in the state, so I'm hoping to have everything ready to go by that time.

So - crazy and exciting times, and I'm looking forward to this next chapter!
