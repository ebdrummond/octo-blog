It has been quite the week, and I'm ending it on a pretty fantastic note.  Before I get to the end though, let's talk about the beginning...

I came into gSchool with zero programming experience, and I knew it was going to be a steep learning curve because of this, but I was hoping I'd pick everything up pretty quickly.  Before the course started, we were assigned a Ruby video course to work through.  I got about halfway through pretty much understanding what was going on and able to keep up with the exercises (although I wasn't fully grasping it as much as I wanted to), but about halfway through I hit a wall.  I looked through some online resources but decided to purchase Chris Pine's Learn to Program book after hearing feedback that it was a very basic, happy to hold your hand introduction to Ruby and to programming.

I went through the book throughout the week, but was still feeling very behind in class and still felt like things hadn't completely clicked, even with the video, the book, two projects, and our Ruby in 100 minutes intro in class combined.  Until this afternoon.

Yesterday I worked on a class project with an awesome classmate, Blair.  He was incredibly nice about explaining everything, letting me ask a ton of questions, and listening to me explain how the code we were writing would work, since I heavily needed his help and couldn't come up with it on my own but wanted to be sure I had the logic down.  I still felt very behind and decided to dedicate my weekend to re-doing Ruby in 100 minutes and the video course until I felt up to speed.  When I did Ri100m today, something clicked.  I can't really explain how amazing that feeling is, when you struggle with something and feel frustrated in your abilities, but then finally break through.  I'm still going to go through the video course again this weekend to ensure I'm up to speed, but I'm going into the weekend feeling great.  Fingers crossed I am getting it enough to finish my weekend assignment without too much pain!

Beyond this I've really enjoyed my first week at gSchool too.  Our first day doing improv pretty much all day was a great introduction and got everyone out of their shell straight away.  I've been blown away by how amazingly nice everyone is, and how willing to help out the more advanced people in class are.  I've had about a billion questions over the course of the week, and not once have I sensed any irritation from classmates, no matter how basic my question.  It's also been great to meet so many people here at Galvanize and hear what their companies are doing - the energy here is really amazing.

I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes next.  Yes, I know it will be stressful and I know there will be plenty more times when things don't click as soon as I may want them to, but I can't wait to dive in!
