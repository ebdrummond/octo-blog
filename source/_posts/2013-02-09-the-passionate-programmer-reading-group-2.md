Upon completion of The Passionate Programmer, there were a few overarching themes that I took from the book.  The first was to be curious - don't just stagnate in the programming language(s) that you know or the technologies that you're used to, but continually strive to learn new languages and new skills.  This helps you to prepare for the future, as most languages come and go and you will have a backup, but also helps you draw from a larger pool of knowledge to implement the best solutions for each project.  Coupled with this is the advice to take smart risks, especially with the 'bleeding edge' of technology - at best, you'll establish yourself in the next big thing, and at worst you've picked up a new skill set that has exercised your mental muscle.

Although I think my generation has thoroughly internalized this message, Chad also urges readers to be proactive about their career.  There is not an expectation anymore that anybody is going to go work for a company for 40 years until they retire, so you must be focused on preparing for the future (without, of course, looking so hard at the next step all the time that you neglect to embrace your job in the moment).  This goes back partially to point number one, in learning new marketable skills if your language of choice becomes obsolete, but also requires that you define yourself outside of your current employment and take care to market yourself well.  Especially with the tech community being so dependent on your network, cultivating relationships is necessary, whether through 'making the hang' with people you admire or cultivating mentor/mentee networks.

Lastly, this book was named The Passionate Programmer for a reason - you have to love what you're doing to be a good programmer.  If you lack a passion for what you're doing, you're probably not going to want to put in the extra work that is needed to get the most out of this career path.  Although anyone should be pursuing work that they love, good programmers are always learning new skills and pushing themselves forward, and it shows in the quality of your work if you don't have that love of programming.

I also liked one of the tips in part V, Better Than Yesterday, in relation to gSchool.  I've been somewhat critical of myself this past week in that my skills are not yet as good as I want them to be (which I do realize is crazy to be this hard on myself in that as of a month ago, I had never touched a command line outside of Word Perfect).  I can sometimes be critical of myself, and I need to embrace taking things a day at a time, focusing on what I can do each day to make the day better than the day before instead of worrying about where I'll be six months from now.  It's easy to look at any large task as daunting and feel overwhelmed or, even worse, immobilized.  Taking it day by day, as long as you're honestly able to answer that you did something to make the day better than yesterday, should be a big help in making it seem more manageable.
