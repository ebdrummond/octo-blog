It was interesting to read Don't Make Me Think - the examples could at times be pretty outdated, but the ideas behind all of the examples were still very relevant for today.  More so than even 10 years ago, people have an unbelieveably short attention span, and you really need to give a user instant gratification in your site or you will lose them.

(As a side note - It was also really entertaining to me to look at the examples and to remember how professional websites looked 10 years ago and laugh.  Granted, in my last job, we looked at a lot of websites from small businesses that were god awful and violated every principle in this book, but 10 years ago that was the case even for large companies.)

One of the ideas that really clicked with me is how users actually use the web versus what we might like to imagine - I thought it was spot on.  When I'm on a site, I hardly ever look at the entire thing, just what I'm specifically visiting the site to look for; once I've found it, that's the end of the road.  This makes it even more important that users need to be able to navigate your site quickly, so intelligible design and naming conventions are key.  Part of keeping everything easy to navigate definitely includes cutting out words - they clutter the page and can make it harder to find what you're looking for.  Lots of text is also pretty easy to ignore - I sometimes find myself getting an error message on a site, and realizing I didn't read the text, precisely because it usually is so easy to ignore.

I also know it violates every rule of DRY, but from a user perspective, it's sometimes good to get to the same destination in three different ways (especially if a site does not have a search functionality).  Take Krug's chainsaw example - why not put that in multiple categories if it's reasonable that a user might look in those categories?

I think the lessons from this book tie in well to our Store Engine project.  We had consciously decided to make our site very clean looking with a lot of whitespace, so that the information on the site really stands out.  There's also very easy links throughout the site to different parts of the site, and an easy flow through to checkout.  To give credit where it's due, we did use bootstrap to help us, so a lot of the thought into the design happened before we touched it, but I think these are still really good principles to keep in mind, even if you are using pre-defined templates, to make sure they are still fulfilling your users' needs.
