I know this is a little late, but better late than never, right?

There's a bunch of people I need to thank for their help in supporting me throughout gSchool.  Without their help, it wouldn't have been as rewarding an experience for me; without some of their help, I wouldn't have been able to do it at all.  A huge thank you to everyone listed here, and to a hundred others who helped me along the way.

* First off, to [Michael Verdi](http://twitter.com/verdi_michael) and [Ed Weng](http://twitter.com/wengzilla) of LivingSocial, for holding the intro to programming workshop that kicked my entire adventure off.  If it hadn't been for their workshop, I would have never realized a) that I could do this and b) how fulfilling it is.
* There were a lot of people who helped me out when I got stressed, but [Lauren Spath Luhring](http://twitter.com/edatrix) and [Aimee Maher](http://twitter.com/aimzatron) were the two people who were there closest to me through the most stressful times and put a smile back on my face.  Thanks, ladies!
* All of the other [gSchool students](http://people.jumpstartlab.com) deserve a big thanks too.  Everyone brought something valuable to the table, and everyone was so helpful - there was a genuine feeling of teamwork throughout the class, and I never felt like anyone was trying to stand up taller by standing on someone else.  I learned so much from all my classmates and hope I helped them learn, too.
* Of course, the fabulous [gSchool instructors](http://jumpstartlab.com/team) were, well, fabulous throughout the course.  One of the reasons I chose gSchool was because of the quality of the instructors, and they didn't let me down.  They knew their shit, were great at teaching the full group, and were also great at providing one on one help and advice.  [Katrina](http://twitter.com/kytrinyx), especially, took the time to give me a lot of one on one help and also made sure I knew she believed in me, letting me know what I was doing great at and what I needed to work on.  I really appreciate the time they all put into all of us students.
* My first mentor, [Jim Denton](http://twitter.com/decoydrone), was amazing.  He was the one who really pushed me and taught me the value of testing by pointing out all the unnecessary headaches I was causing myself.  I really appreciated all the time he spent with me, sometimes an entire afternoon, whipping me into shape and showing me a new way of thinking.
* A huge thank you also to my second mentor, [Ashish Dixit](http://twitter.com/tundal45).  Ashish has had awesome ideas for how to refactor some of my gnarliest code, and also introduced me to Table XI - something I can't thank him for enough.  More than that, he's helped point me in the right direction with my jitters on starting my first programming job, and has offered to continue to be my mentor post-gSchool (which is awesome since we'll both be in Chicago!).  He is amazingly smart, so open to helping, and really excited about the broader Ruby community - I feel so lucky to have been teamed up with him.
* More than anyone else though, my biggest thanks go out to my wonderful husband, [Brock](http://twitter.com/brock).  I quite literally could not have done this without his support, and support me he did.  He was so excited for me when I decided I wanted to become a programmer, and didn't mind relocating with me to Denver.  Throughout the course he has done most of the housework and took care of the dog when I was studying all the time and helped me out with programming questions throughout the course whenever he could.  He was also so emotionally supportive when I was frustrated, stressed, and drained, and is relocating with me all over again to Chicago without complaint.  I don't know how I got so lucky to have him.
