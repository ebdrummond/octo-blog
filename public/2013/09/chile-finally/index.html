<div class="entry-content"><p>Before gSchool even started, we found out our friends Sarah and Rod were getting married a few weeks after gSchool graduation.  They live in Santiago, Chile and were getting married down there, so we figured it was the perfect trip to a) see the two of them, since we obviously don&rsquo;t get to see each other very often, and b) take a much needed vacation after six months of non-stop work at gSchool.  Turned out it worked just fine with my eventual job too, since I didn&rsquo;t start until September, and we would be taking off for Chile at the beginning of August.</p>

<p>We flew in to Santiago, and it was really interesting to see the city during our cab ride in.  Like any city, there are upscale areas and less affluent areas, and we saw a lot of everything on our way in.  Besides a lot of houses in the less affluent areas with corrugated roofing, it looked a lot like any American city, except with more graffiti and lots of stray dogs (more on that later).</p>

<p>We ended up staying at a penthouse condo in a really nice area of the city that we found on <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/387159">VRBO</a> that had a great view of the city.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/santiago_view.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>We met up with Sarah, Rod, and her family for dinner that first night and got to see the neighborhood where Sarah and Rod live.  We also had the chance to ride the metro in Santiago - it was the cleanest public transit I&rsquo;ve been on in my life, and super easy to use.</p>

<p>The next day was the wedding, which took place at this adorable little restaurant, bakery, and event space, <a href="http://www.kuchenhaus.cl">Kuchen Haus</a>.  It was a beautiful wedding - the official parts were in Spanish, but the vows were done in Spanish and in English, and it was really beautiful to watch and was such a reminder that love has no boundaries.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/sarah_rod_wedding.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>The reception was so much fun.  Lots to eat and drink, tons of dancing, and we learned that one stereotype at least is true - the Chileans were much, MUCH better dancers than any of us gringos.  I&rsquo;m fairly certain that Rod must be able to dislocate his hips at will, because I&rsquo;m not sure how else he was able to bust out some of those moves.</p>

<p>It was also cool to interact more with Rod&rsquo;s family once everyone had a bit to drink and was less shy about the language divide.  There&rsquo;s also this great tradition at Chilean weddings - people like to party to the wee hours, so in the middle of the night, guests are served chicken soup to give them more energy and strength so they can keep going for a few more hours.</p>

<p>The next day we slept in since we were still pretty jet lagged and recovering from the night before, and then explored the city a bit.  The presidential palace, La Moneda, was all blocked off for renovations, so you really couldn&rsquo;t see much of anything.  The surrounding areas reminded me of DC though - pretty dead since it wasn&rsquo;t a weekday, but filled with a lot of businesses that cater to the proximity to the palace.</p>

<p>We just kind of walk down the main boulevard the palace is on for a few miles, and ran into Cerro Santa Lucia, this little hill in the middle of the city that used to be a military fort, but is now decked out with fountains and really beautiful facades.  It&rsquo;s not a huge hill, but it had a great view of the city at sunset - I was really glad we happened to run across it.  It was one of the most beautiful sights in Santiago.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/cerro_santa_lucia.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>The following day we spent with Sarah&rsquo;s family as well as her other gringo friends from Australia going on a winery tour at <a href="http://www.undurraga.cl/undurraga/?lang=en">Vina Undurraga</a>.  Since it was winter there wasn&rsquo;t anything growing, but we still got the tour of everything and the wine tasting.  More than anything it was just nice to spend a low key day with everyone before people started taking off.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/chile_gang.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>The next day we took one of those open air double decker bus tours of Santiago.  It&rsquo;s the middle of winter there in August, but we lucked out - it was in the 60s for the most part during our trip and sunny almost every day, so it wasn&rsquo;t uncomfortable to spend the whole day outside in just a sweater.  The bus tour was all right, and we got off at certain points to walk around and explore.  Anyone trying to get tourists into their shops or restaurants had a field day harrassing us.  It&rsquo;s pretty damned obvious with my blonde hair I&rsquo;m not from there, so we cut our exploring around the central market a bit short.</p>

<p>We spent the next few days in Valparaiso, Chile with Sarah and Rod, who decided to postpone their honeymoon and didn&rsquo;t mind spending their post-wedding vacation time with us.</p>

<p>Valparaiso is absolutely gorgeous.  Santiago may be the biggest city and the commercial power in Chile, but Valpo has the soul.  It&rsquo;s right on the ocean, and the city is built on huge hills, so the city is full of beautiful views and winding streets.  A lot of the houses are brightly colored, so it&rsquo;s visually stunning to look at.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/valpo.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>Exploring Valpo at night was a lot of fun.  There&rsquo;s little commercial strips tucked here and there in neighborhoods up in the hills, away from the main part of the city closer to the water.  I wish I remembered the name of the restaurant, but we ate dinner our first night at a pizza place, and it was literally the best pizza I&rsquo;ve had in my life.  I say this as someone who has had Chicago pizza from some of the best places now - still doesn&rsquo;t come close to this little place in Valpo.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting in Chile - people tend to eat really late at night, so we ended up taking a nap at 5 or 6 a few days, sleeping a few hours, and then going out to get dinner.  It was actually quite refreshing, and we had a second wind to explore the city a bit and see it in a different way.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/valpo_street.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>One thing about Valpo is there&rsquo;s street art literally everywhere, of all different kinds.  One of the guys in my gSchool class created an app to track street art for his individual project, and he would have had a field day in Valpo.  To me, the street art we saw was a major component in what made the city so charming.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/valpo_street_art.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>We had to see Pablo Neruda&rsquo;s Valparaiso house, La Sebastiana, while we were in Valpo, and it was gorgeous inside and out.  Even if you don&rsquo;t know Neruda&rsquo;s work, see his house if you&rsquo;re ever in Valparaiso - so beautiful and it makes you feel creative and alive just walking through it.  Don&rsquo;t skip the audio tour in English.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/la_sebastiana.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>The most unique form of transport in Valparaiso is the funicular.  Since the city is so hilly (to the point there were a few streets we could not get up in a car with four people plus luggage) and with so many winding streets, they built these little railway elevator things in the late 19th century that are still in use today.  It&rsquo;s a great way to get around, and as for me, I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about the Motorcycle Diaries every time I rode in one.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/funicular.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>The rest of our stay in Santiago, we just took in the city.  We visited an old prison in the city that was notorious under Pinochet, that has since been turned into a museum and cultural center, with lots of meeting space for classes and events.  It struck me simultaneously as slightly creepy, but also a way to help the community heal, and turn what was an awful place with deplorable conditions into a place the community can gather to take cooking classes and ballet lessons - it&rsquo;s a way to move on.  We also got to see the college Rod went to, which is absolutely gorgeous, and took a boat tour on the harbor to get some amazing views of the city.</p>

<p>I was really sad to leave Valpo.  The atmosphere is relaxed, the people so nice, the city so beautiful, the food so good - I was tempted to stay there on a permanent vacation, but I&rsquo;ll settle for going back one day for a longer stay.</p>

<p>We spent our last day in Chile with Sarah and Rod in Santiago before heading back to the airport.  We went up to Cerro San Cristobal, this massive hill that&rsquo;s in the middle of the city, for a better view and to take one last look around before we left.  It&rsquo;s beautiful from up there, but it was a bit smoggy that day and my camera isn&rsquo;t that great.  Below is a professional picture of Santiago right after a rain, so the smog was cleared up.  It really is a beautiful city with the Andes in the background.
<br><br>

<br><br></p>

<p>And then it was back to the airport, and back to real life :(
<br><br><br>
Just some general thoughts on Chile:</p>

<ul>
<li>So, I mentioned at the beginning of this post the stray dogs.  They are EVERYWHERE in Chile.  At first I didn&rsquo;t get it - there had been a bunch of islands in the Caribbean where there were stray dogs, but it was pretty clear there that people didn&rsquo;t have money to spay or neuter.  Chile is a wealthy country.  The dogs in the islands were also scrawny with obvious health issues.  In Chile, they looked well fed and well taken care of - there were a bunch that even had sweaters on for the winter.  Turns out, it&rsquo;s a cultural thing - from what I was told, Chileans believe it is against God&rsquo;s will to spay or neuter a dog.  They were put on this earth to reproduce, so that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going to let them do.  I saw plenty of people putting food out for the dogs, so at least if people hold this attitude, they&rsquo;re taking care of them.</li>
</ul>


<p>It was really sad for me though, because these were still dogs - they wanted love just as much as my puppy.  They still knew if you looked them in the eye, they might get some food or love out of you, so they&rsquo;d walk over with their ears down and their tail wagging.  I had a really hard time with this, and against everyone&rsquo;s advice, I couldn&rsquo;t help petting the dogs.  Even strays need love.
<br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/street_dog_valpo.jpg">
<br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>People in Chile are super nice.  Everywhere we went, even if people didn&rsquo;t speak English well, they went out of their way to be helpful and kind.  This wasn&rsquo;t just people in the service industry, but people we met everywhere.  I&rsquo;d honestly say it rivaled New Zealand for friendliness.</p></li>
<li><p>The food in Chile is phenomenal.  Everywhere we went, it was fantastic, whether it was Chilean food or ethnic food (who knew Chile had such good Lebanese?).  They love their sandwiches, meat, and seafood, but I think one of the things I enjoyed the most was the most simple - mashed up avocado on toast.</p></li>
<li><p>Chilean drivers are crazy.</p></li>
<li><p>Every time I travel, I can&rsquo;t help but think of stereotypes, and how wrong they tend to be.  On this trip, I thought a lot about the typical American view of all of Latin America as poor, dangerous, and filled with drug smugglers.  Sarah even mentioned a close friend warned her to be careful of the drugs when she moved to Chile.  I can&rsquo;t get over how some Americans don&rsquo;t realize how diverse Latin America is, and differentiate the countries.  Chile is the most advanced, wealthy country in Latin America with a human development index in the same range as the United States.  Seeing different parts of the country, it was hard to think of it as very exotic at times given Santiago especially looked in many neighborhoods like any large city in North America or Europe.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There were parts of the city that looked pretty rundown, and whenever I visit another country that Americans stereotype as poor, it makes me think Oh, this is what they&rsquo;re thinking of when they visualize this place.  Which then just makes me think of all the parts of America that wealthy Americans are so good at forgetting about, the poor areas that they never see and the people they consciously forget about as much as possible.</p>

<p>Never let a stereotype stop you from traveling somewhere.  Look into it, do your research - chances are your assumptions were incorrect and you&rsquo;d be missing out on an amazing experience.
<br><br></p>

<p>So, to sign off - bye, Rod and Sarah.  We had a great time, and I hope we get to see you again soon!
