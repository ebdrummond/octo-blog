<div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed this focus week and the chance to catch my breath and review what I&rsquo;ve learned so far.  I started the week, quite frankly, pretty surprised with the group I was in - I thought for sure I would be in the refresher group, but I was placed in the intermediate group, where we worked on re-doing Sales Engine in the context of a web app.  It was honestly really helpful for me to be able to re-do an old project with the knowledge that I now have.  When I first did Sales Engine, it was a struggle for me, the code I wrote felt very awkward, and some of what Jeff/Raphael helped us with for code creation and refactoring was still really fuzzy in my mind.  This go around, I felt more confident I understood the concepts, and the code felt a lot more natural to me.  I also focused much more intensively on testing, which I think helped to instill confidence in my code as I was writing it, and helped me to catch bugs early on.</p>

<p>In fact, I made a really dumb mistake in my code - to create new object instances between classes, I used each instead of collect, which gave me all the information I needed&hellip; as hashes, not as objects.  I noticed my code wasn&rsquo;t working the way I wanted it to, and quickly discovered it was broken, leading me to (with Laura&rsquo;s help) find my mistake.  If I hadn&rsquo;t been testing as intensively as I was, I don&rsquo;t know that I would have found it as quickly.</p>

<p>Even though the focus week is formally over, I&rsquo;m not done with this project and I&rsquo;d like to keep working on it, if for nothing else than to prove to myself that I can do this.  I know I&rsquo;ve really struggled with self-confidence during this course so far, but I feel like I&rsquo;m turning a corner and the ability to keep up with this project relatively well has been a big boost for me.  That, and when I have a problem I can&rsquo;t work out or a project that&rsquo;s not complete, my brain doesn&rsquo;t want to let it go.  I want to keep working on it til it&rsquo;s done and I can see everything working.  I still feel a kind of rush when I see my code working, similar to that first tingling I felt all the way back at LivingSocial when I went to the intro to programming workshop.  While I do sometimes still feel some anxiety that I&rsquo;m not learning quickly enough, I still really like what I&rsquo;m doing.  I can&rsquo;t wait to see what I can do once this program is over.  I never would have thought I&rsquo;d have learned all that I know now in such a short period of time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just scratched the surface on this, but I&rsquo;m really interested in learning more about controllers and the MVC model.  I understand as a concept what the controller does, but I&rsquo;m still not clear on how to execute everything in my code.  For this project, for example, where do I validate that a link someone has requested exists?  In the controller, in the router?  I have been trying to finish up the business intelligence component since I still want to become more confident in objects interacting, but once that piece is complete I&rsquo;d like to play around with the controller model Jeff showed us and see if I can figure out some answers.</p>

<p>One area I still feel shaky on is starting a project.  For this one, I was really glad Jeff started it with us, and helped to guide us in the right direction.  Even though I knew Sales Engine at this point and what it did, starting out on my own would have been difficult.  If there&rsquo;s one thing at the top of my agenda going forward, it&rsquo;s to get better at deconstructing spec requirements better so that I don&rsquo;t feel quite so overwhelmed and have a clear idea on how/where to start a new project.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m really glad that the calendar was modified for this focus week.  It was really helpful to me and to a lot of other people I&rsquo;ve talked to.  I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s feasible, but I&rsquo;d love to have another one later on in the course if we reach another point where a lot of people are feeling really behind&hellip; although I hope this week has helped enough so that we don&rsquo;t feel as behind anymore!</p>
