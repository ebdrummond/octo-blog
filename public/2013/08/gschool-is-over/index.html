<div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&rsquo;t been updating this as much as I should be, but wanted to post an update on my last month of gSchool and what&rsquo;s been going on since it&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p>My last month of gSchool was pretty hectic with job searching.  I really wanted to take my time to interview with a variety of companies, and find the place that was the best fit for my top two priorities: firstly, I wanted to find a place that was a good fit for me culturally, where I liked the people I was working with, and looked forward to coming in and working with them every day, and where their values were consistent with my own.  Secondly, it was imperative that I work with a company where I could continue to learn, and that would nurture my ongoing learning process.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to just take the first thing that came along, so I really took the time to get to know a number of companies to find the best one for me.  This meant a lot of phone interviews, skype interviews, in person interviews, and take home coding challenges.  I felt pretty bad, because given how busy I was with the interview process, I wasn&rsquo;t able to put in the time that I wanted to on my group projects.  Everyone understood though; everyone else was doing the same.</p>

<p>At the end of it, I came away with three job offers from wonderful companies, any of which I could see myself enjoying culturally, and where I would learn a ton from awesome co-workers and interesting projects.  It was especially difficult as the offers were all from my top three cities - Chicago, Portland, and Denver.  In the end, I decided to accept the offer as a software developer with <a href="http://www.tablexi.com">Table XI</a> in Chicago, for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I love Chicago.  It&rsquo;s an amazing city, with a ton to do.  I&rsquo;ve always considered myself a city person, and I am really excited to get back to a large city with a ton of cultural options, great public transit, people from all over the world - all in America&rsquo;s third largest city.  It helps a lot too that even though it&rsquo;s a huge city, it&rsquo;s still the Midwest, so people are incredibly nice there.  Also the cost of living, especially compared to DC, is great.  Also I have a bunch of friends from college there.  Also the food there is incredible.  Really, just a lot of alsos.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m back within driving distance of my family, which I haven&rsquo;t been since college.  Speaking of college, I&rsquo;m also within driving distance of East Lansing, so I can go back home and catch some Spartan football and basketball games!  Go Green!</li>
<li>Most importantly, I felt that Table XI was the very best fit for me personally.  There are so many things that I love about them, and throughout the interview process, there were a hundred little moments where I just knew this was where I was supposed to be.  The people are all amazingly smart, excited about the work they&rsquo;re doing, happy to help, and yet humble and super nice.  It&rsquo;s a consultancy, so there&rsquo;s a bunch of different projects they get to work on.  They do a lot of work with community groups and non-profits, which is a great fit for my social relations background - even though I&rsquo;m not saving the world full time anymore, it&rsquo;s still one of my values.  The people stay there long term because they genuinely love working there.  There&rsquo;s about ten more pages worth of things I could say about how great Table XI is, but long story short - I&rsquo;m unbelievably excited to start working there and am so thankful I have this opportunity.</li>
</ul>


<p>The actual end of gSchool has been bittersweet.  On one hand, I&rsquo;m happy the madness is over and excited to be moving on to my new job, but on the other, I really miss working with all my classmates - they were amazing people and I made some good friends there.  We had a big party the last day, both at Galvanize and later on at Chris&rsquo;s house, and it was so good to let everything out and spend one last (quite memorable) night with everyone, but I also realized this is likely the last time we were all going to be together.</p>

<p>Since gSchool ended, it&rsquo;s still been a whirlwind.  We started looking into relocating to Chicago, I flew out to Chicago to find an apartment (success!  We&rsquo;ll be living in West Lakeview), we visited our friends in Chile (separate post forthcoming), and now I&rsquo;m trying to cram in all the Denver things I didn&rsquo;t have time to do during gSchool, and meeting up with all my friends here one last time before I leave.  On top of that, I need to pick my sister&rsquo;s New Leaf Massage site back up, and have some books I want to read before starting with Table XI, so this is definitely not a lazy vacation for me!  I did get some reprieve on New Leaf though - my sister just found out she&rsquo;s relocating to Phoenix for her husband&rsquo;s job, and it takes about six months to get set up as a massage therapist in the state, so I&rsquo;m hoping to have everything ready to go by that time.</p>

<p>So - crazy and exciting times, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to this next chapter!</p>
