  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was really interesting for me to read the CSS portion of this book - I&rsquo;ve never had any experience with CSS before, and it&rsquo;s interesting to see all the design elements you can implement with pure CSS alone.</p>

<p>I tried to experiment a bit with updating my blog, but had limited success - I think part of it was that the layouts were written in haml, not HTML, which I would have found really helpful in modifying, saying, a .panel class.</p>

<p>Most of what I did (I had previously already tweaked the colors of my blog) was with trying to manipulate the title bar a bit.  I&rsquo;m still not super happy with it, but I can fiddle around with it later.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what it was:
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/ss1.png" /></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s what it is now:
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/ss2.png" /></p>

<p>with code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>h2 {
</span><span class='line'>  font-size: 40px;
</span><span class='line'>  letter-spacing: 0.06em;
</span><span class='line'>  word-spacing: 0.06em;
</span><span class='line'>  text-shadow: -1px 1px 10px #704111;
</span><span class='line'>}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Again, really not to happy with it, but more to come soon!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed this focus week and the chance to catch my breath and review what I&rsquo;ve learned so far.  I started the week, quite frankly, pretty surprised with the group I was in - I thought for sure I would be in the refresher group, but I was placed in the intermediate group, where we worked on re-doing Sales Engine in the context of a web app.  It was honestly really helpful for me to be able to re-do an old project with the knowledge that I now have.  When I first did Sales Engine, it was a struggle for me, the code I wrote felt very awkward, and some of what Jeff/Raphael helped us with for code creation and refactoring was still really fuzzy in my mind.  This go around, I felt more confident I understood the concepts, and the code felt a lot more natural to me.  I also focused much more intensively on testing, which I think helped to instill confidence in my code as I was writing it, and helped me to catch bugs early on.</p>

<p>In fact, I made a really dumb mistake in my code - to create new object instances between classes, I used each instead of collect, which gave me all the information I needed&hellip; as hashes, not as objects.  I noticed my code wasn&rsquo;t working the way I wanted it to, and quickly discovered it was broken, leading me to (with Laura&rsquo;s help) find my mistake.  If I hadn&rsquo;t been testing as intensively as I was, I don&rsquo;t know that I would have found it as quickly.</p>

<p>Even though the focus week is formally over, I&rsquo;m not done with this project and I&rsquo;d like to keep working on it, if for nothing else than to prove to myself that I can do this.  I know I&rsquo;ve really struggled with self-confidence during this course so far, but I feel like I&rsquo;m turning a corner and the ability to keep up with this project relatively well has been a big boost for me.  That, and when I have a problem I can&rsquo;t work out or a project that&rsquo;s not complete, my brain doesn&rsquo;t want to let it go.  I want to keep working on it til it&rsquo;s done and I can see everything working.  I still feel a kind of rush when I see my code working, similar to that first tingling I felt all the way back at LivingSocial when I went to the intro to programming workshop.  While I do sometimes still feel some anxiety that I&rsquo;m not learning quickly enough, I still really like what I&rsquo;m doing.  I can&rsquo;t wait to see what I can do once this program is over.  I never would have thought I&rsquo;d have learned all that I know now in such a short period of time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just scratched the surface on this, but I&rsquo;m really interested in learning more about controllers and the MVC model.  I understand as a concept what the controller does, but I&rsquo;m still not clear on how to execute everything in my code.  For this project, for example, where do I validate that a link someone has requested exists?  In the controller, in the router?  I have been trying to finish up the business intelligence component since I still want to become more confident in objects interacting, but once that piece is complete I&rsquo;d like to play around with the controller model Jeff showed us and see if I can figure out some answers.</p>

<p>One area I still feel shaky on is starting a project.  For this one, I was really glad Jeff started it with us, and helped to guide us in the right direction.  Even though I knew Sales Engine at this point and what it did, starting out on my own would have been difficult.  If there&rsquo;s one thing at the top of my agenda going forward, it&rsquo;s to get better at deconstructing spec requirements better so that I don&rsquo;t feel quite so overwhelmed and have a clear idea on how/where to start a new project.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m really glad that the calendar was modified for this focus week.  It was really helpful to me and to a lot of other people I&rsquo;ve talked to.  I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s feasible, but I&rsquo;d love to have another one later on in the course if we reach another point where a lot of people are feeling really behind&hellip; although I hope this week has helped enough so that we don&rsquo;t feel as behind anymore!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of times it&rsquo;s been stressful and it&rsquo;s so easy to get completely discouraged - when there&rsquo;s those damned RSpec errors that will not go away no matter what you do, or when you are just plain not getting what&rsquo;s going on.  But the feeling you get when you finally figure something out - whether it&rsquo;s an a-ha! moment or just a technical issue you&rsquo;ve been struggling with for a while - that&rsquo;s what makes it worth it.  I need to keep this feeling in my back pocket for those stressful times and remind myself the confetti will rain again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found this reading to be really interesting.  I took a class all the way back in my freshman year of high school on basic html, and it was surprising how much looked the same.  The things that have changed are pretty exciting - no more fontface, no more cell padding.  I also didn&rsquo;t realize how much that used to be done purely in html is moving over as a function of CSS.</p>

<p>The reading was pretty basic to me, and there wasn&rsquo;t really anything that was confusing.  There were a few techniques I haven&rsquo;t used before, but everything clicked with me as a concept.  The thing that I hadn&rsquo;t ever used before at all was a form, and it was really neat to see everything that you can do with forms.  I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to putz around too much, but I was really interested in trying to build a multiple select box form, so that users are able to select multiple values from a list.  To me, this seemed the most challenging of the forms to implement while the others were pretty straight forward, and is a great way to allow users to select multiple values in the event you have a long list where individual checkboxes may take up too much room.</p>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s my attempt at coding this in a fieldset:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Traffic Spy is another one for the books.  This was definitely the most interesting project I have worked on so far, but the start of the project was also the most foreign to me.  I feel pretty good about the project now that it&rsquo;s done, but I would be completely remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention how thankful I am to have worked with Kyle as my partner.  He did a lot of the mental heavy lifting for this project and was able to figure out how to implement a lot of the logic we worked through at the start.  I mostly took what he had figured out and applied it to other classes and methods and erb files, so I feel like I learned a lot in the project, but I definitely think he carried the project more than I did in terms of figuring out the original implementations.</p>

<p>One of the things I really liked about this project was once something was built, we could see a tangible output on our site.  With Sinatra + shotgun, if I tweaked the sort of something here or the look of the html there, I could see immediately exactly what I had done.  It was also pretty exciting to show this off to my friends - I don&rsquo;t think showing them Sales Engine would have had the same appeal.</p>

<p>As I move forward, I definitely want to learn how to better control my controller - I noticed most people had the problem that they were able to keep their model classes (relatively) tidy, but the controller was a bit crazy.  Especially with all the if else logic, I&rsquo;d like to learn how to clean this up for the next project, but it was neat to finally get a handle on the MVC model - when we had talked about it in class, I really didn&rsquo;t fully appreciate how it worked, but now that I&rsquo;ve worked with it, I must say I&rsquo;m a fan.</p>

<p>I think if I could go back and re-start this project from the beginning, I would spend more time screwing around with Sequel and get a better idea of database manipulation.  I got the basics of it, but once we were doing higher level combining of tables and searches, I knew logically what I wanted to do, but I couldn&rsquo;t fully figure out the implementation on my own.  We were really lucky, though, in having Frank and Jeff help to guide us in setting up the project and taking our time laying everything out before we started to write any code.  Frank definitely led us in the right direction with creating databases that were a lot more work upfront, but then everything fell into place relatively quickly.  We actually had a pretty relaxed pace the second week of the project because of this - we realized over the weekend most other groups were ahead of us, so we worked pretty long hours over the weekend to catch up and stay on pace, but the way we had structured our project, once the database connections were figured out, everything else was pretty quick to implement.  I hadn&rsquo;t really realized just how quickly the second half would go, but it was nice not to have a ton to scramble on during week two, so I had time to continue to study and play around with our code.</p>

<p>Also this week, I was able to catch the Obama For America team at Galvanize.  I knew I would find the content interesting, but I wasn&rsquo;t really prepared for how much the progressive nerd in me would come out.  It was so exciting to hear them, and I can only imagine the insane emotional rush and the pride they must have felt on election night, realizing they played a big role in making it happen.  When I originally graduated college, the thing I wanted most in the world was to work for a non-profit whose mission I cared deeply about, and then go out and change the world.  That didn&rsquo;t much work out, but I&rsquo;m pretty excited that with this new career, I&rsquo;ll have another crack at that dream, whether it&rsquo;s working directly for an awesome non-profit or socially conscious/progressive company, working with a company who does work for those organizations, or at the very least being able to lend a hand through volunteering.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want to completely put my life on hold to work on a political campaign like they did (I worked a lot of 60 hour weeks at my last job and felt significant burn out after a while; even if I&rsquo;m passionate about what I&rsquo;m doing, I don&rsquo;t think I could sustain the pace that long), but it is really awesome to know I can still contribute meaningfully to causes I care deeply about.  Back in DC, there was a group that coordinated volunteers with professional skills to assist non-profit institutions (I can&rsquo;t for the life of me remember the name) that Brock used to volunteer for, working on projects like building a website for a local homeless shelter.  I&rsquo;m wondering if there&rsquo;s anything comparable here in Denver and if not, how hard it would be to go about starting something like that.</p>

<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s been a pretty good week.  I&rsquo;m hoping a lot of the database and web stuff I learned has sunk in enough to help propel me through the next project, being able to contribute more upfront, but I feel in a relatively good place right now, and mostly just excited to keep going.  It&rsquo;s starting to sink on a whole new level lately just how damned lucky I am to be here, and I want to squeeze out of this experience everything I can.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The metaprogramming section of Eloquent Ruby was a really interesting read, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to my skill level being advanced enough to take advantage of these methods, but as with large parts of the rest of the book, my main takeaway was that EQ will be an excellent reference once I have a better handle on what I&rsquo;m doing.  At my current skill level, I have to say &lsquo;Hell no!&rsquo; to even attempting to implement most of what I read - I have a feeling that in no time at all, I&rsquo;d have completely jacked up Ruby if I attempted it now.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to making good use of method_missing and aliases for those times you know users may get a term or syntax wrong, and you can proactively correct it for them.  Self-modification in your program sounds like a great idea, but right now the thought kind of terrifies me, in that all I can think is that with great power comes great responsibility to know what the hell you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d recommend Eloquent Ruby to anyone at or near my current skill level.  Again, I now know what I can reference in the future, but as far as what I can takeaway and use right now, the impact was limited.  I think it would be much more impactful to read this once I have a better command of Ruby and more confidence in my own abilities and knowledge of what&rsquo;s going on with my code.  This is no knock at all on the author or the book; just a knock on my current abilities!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First class week of Traffic Spy is on the books.  This has been a really difficult assignment for me.  I think I understand how each of the individual pieces (Sinatra, databases, Ruby) work individually, but when I try to put them together, my brain just freezes up.  It&rsquo;s been hard to start, but I&rsquo;m really glad my partner and I spent a good amount of time upfront conceptualizing how the pieces of the project would fit together instead of feeling we had to rush into code.  I&rsquo;ve found that even though we do have a good idea of how the pieces fit, starting the coding has been difficult - we&rsquo;ll get one piece in, and then feel really confused about how to take a next step.  We&rsquo;re also getting really conflicting advice when we ask for help, but I think we&rsquo;ve done relatively well at not spinning our wheels too much, picking a direction, and going for it.  I know this will eventually sink in, but I&rsquo;m not there yet.  I feel really lucky to have a partner that&rsquo;s been really understanding, but I feel I haven&rsquo;t personally contributed very much brain power to this project.</p>

<p>I reached out this week to a Hungry Academy alumnus that I had heard struggled through the course to get his perspective on what I can do to keep up and absorb as much as I can.  His advice was to keep studying and ask a ton of questions, but he felt behind for most of the program as well and is only now feeling comfortable with Ruby and Rails.  I&rsquo;ve definitely gotten more comfortable asking questions, but I still feel like I want to do my best to try to work through all these new ideas before I ask questions to see if I can work through it on my own - I try to look up ideas and let the learning sink in before asking questions, but when we have a limited amount of time to complete a project, I&rsquo;m not sure the best approach.  I also sometimes feel like I don&rsquo;t even know how to formulate a question to get a meaningful answer on what I don&rsquo;t know.  I do wish there was more opportunity for small groups of people who are feeling a little behind like me to work through some of these new ideas with the instructors in a structured environment.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;m really trying to focus on Do I know more today than I did yesterday, and the answer every day is yes.  I&rsquo;m trying to keep this foremost in my mind as I keep working through projects and learning new systems.  I know it&rsquo;s going to get better and that it&rsquo;s unrealistic that I&rsquo;m going to have mastered every single thing we&rsquo;re exposed to in gSchool by the time we graduate.  Still, I am looking forward to making better sense of how to get tools like Sinatra, databases, and my base Ruby knowledge to interact - this is really a lot more exciting to me conceptually than what we&rsquo;ve been doing, but it&rsquo;s also a lot more difficult to sort out.</p>

<p>I am also pretty nervous about our skills evaluation.  I have learned a tremendous amount in such a short timespan, but because there&rsquo;s so much new information in my head, it gets jumbled up and I haven&rsquo;t been able to absorb everything I&rsquo;ve learned.  I am looking forward to seeing an objective assessment of where I am though so I know what to concentrate on studying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I still can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s only been a week and a half since we started Sales Engine.  Looking back, it feels like three weeks have been packed into a week and a half.  I remember when I started the project, I felt awful - I struggled to start, required a ton of guidance, and didn&rsquo;t feel like I understood my code very well.  I felt very defeated during parts of that first week.  Now that we&rsquo;re done, I feel great - the weekend and second week went much more smoothly for me - the logic came a little bit easier, and when, like our warm-up exercises, I got the logic down but had some hiccups with execution, I felt less reserved about asking for help.  I think it has helped to watch our instructors work on warm-up exercises in front of the class and see that they, too, get input from the other instructors.  I guess it&rsquo;s taken the stigma out of it a bit.  The last part of the project, after thinking on it overnight and working for a while, I didn&rsquo;t know how to start, and felt comfortable asking for guidance instead of spinning my wheels and feeling frustrated like I would have before.</p>

<p>I also think back to Passionate Programmer, when Chad talks about how explaining something can help you understand what you&rsquo;re doing on a deeper level than just writing the code.  I also found that to be the case a few times in the second half of this project, when I had completed code and was explaining it to someone else.  I didn&rsquo;t always explain it in the best way that clicked immediately with them, but it felt good to help other people and I really did find I even understood it better myself when I was explaining how and why I had written the code I did.  I also found throughout the project that I liked working in a pair more and more.  I was able to bounce ideas off someone, talk problems out, I was held accountable to explain what I was doing, and I couldn&rsquo;t waste too much time futzing on something I knew I didn&rsquo;t know - it wasn&rsquo;t just my time I was wasting.  It was good to have a second set of hands to help and a second set of eyes to ask &lsquo;why did you do that?  Are you sure you don&rsquo;t need to do this instead?&rsquo;  It also felt great to share in the happiness of completing the project, made that much sweeter by the frustration we shared along the way.</p>

<p>I do wonder if I had to complete the project all over again, if I could without help.  I think at this point I would not be able to do it completely un-aided, but I felt the repetition inherent in this project really helped me, because there were certain things that I did so many times, it sunk in way deeper than if I had only done it once or twice, such as the relationships portion of the project.  I do still think I need practice on the business intelligence-type portion; the way objects interacted in the relationship iteration was pretty straightforward and only took one or two hops between objects.  The business intelligence was a little more complicated - objects got up in each others business, and I think I could learn that component better before moving on.  It was my intention this weekend to go through all of my code to write what each method does to help with this, but it looks like we may be doing that this afternoon in class.</p>

<p>So&hellip; first real project is finished.  Do I feel like a developer?  Answer is still no.  I feel like my confidence went up a bit towards the end of this project, and I&rsquo;m still in awe of how much I&rsquo;ve learned in only one month, but I still had a ton of questions and things I didn&rsquo;t know how to do with this project.  I&rsquo;m still learning how OO programming works and don&rsquo;t have all the concepts down.  It doesn&rsquo;t feel natural to me yet.  I think that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;ll feel like a developer - when the language feels more natural, and I can start to &lsquo;think in Ruby&rsquo;.  I remember feeling like I was starting to make progress in learning French (before a semester in Japan learning Japanese wiped it all out) when I could think in French, even if basic.  Once I get to that point with programming, I think I&rsquo;ll feel like a developer.  Until then, I&rsquo;m an enthusiastic learner and really excited to get to that day.  I do still feel like I&rsquo;m on the right path though and this program was a good decision for me.  I still get so excited when I figure something out, especially if it&rsquo;s on my own, but even if I need help.  It feels exhilarating to me to look at this project (which I know is small in terms of what we&rsquo;ll be doing later on, but felt pretty monumental in the moment), see it run, and think Yeah, I built that.  There&rsquo;s a certain je ne sais quoi, but I feel a rush when I&rsquo;m writing code and learn something new or figure something out, whether it&rsquo;s a warm-up exercise or a big project like this.  I&rsquo;m still waiting for a lot of &lsquo;a-ha&rsquo; moments, but I think my biggest one so far is how much I like doing this.  I really can&rsquo;t wait til my skill level catches up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before picking up Eloquent Ruby, I had used symbols in my code numerous times, but never really understood why it was I was using them.  I had them explained to me a few different places, but why I was using them was still a little difficult for me to master.  After the chapter on symbols, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll still jump to the knowing exactly when would be the best time to use a symbol, but the way the information was presented in the book, I feel like when I am led to use them now, I will understand why I&rsquo;m doing so - I&rsquo;m using &lsquo;the eyes peering out from the tilted head of a confused but friendly dog&rsquo; because I want the symbol to be a constant in a way that a string is not.</p>

<p>A large part of the Eloquent Ruby book so far has been an interesting read, but a lot of the information hasn&rsquo;t sunk in deep enough for me to have had an &lsquo;a-ha!&rsquo; moment with what&rsquo;s being taught.  One of the areas this is especially true is regular expressions.  Again, regular expressions have been explained to me a few different ways, but (especially as I haven&rsquo;t used them very much in my code yet), their usage hasn&rsquo;t clicked with me yet.  I have found this book to be very accessible though, even if I haven&rsquo;t quite mastered all the concepts presented, so that I&rsquo;m hoping it will be easy to dive back in a re-introduce myself once I&rsquo;m further along in my journey and ready to let some more &lsquo;a-ha&rsquo; moments sink in.</p>

<p>One area presented in the book that is really emphasizing what I&rsquo;m learning outside of the book is the insistence on test coverage for your code, which I&rsquo;m learning through our Sales Engine project is really helpful.  When we first covered testing, I was most excited about it given that it forces you to write tiny little chunks of code at a time instead of feeling like you have to break off a huge class or relationship, which may or may not work in the end.  During Sales Engine, I&rsquo;ve discovered this to be true, but have also found a few instances where I&rsquo;ve been able to quickly address flaws in my logic through testing instead of forging on and discovering the mess later, when other relationships may have been built on my flawed logic.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also noticing concepts addressed in the book that I have not learned about yet - sub and superclasses, dynamic typing versus static type checking, etc.  While my main focus right now is on finishing Sales Engine, I&rsquo;ve created a list of these topics that I&rsquo;d like to dig more deeply into in some free time, so I have more background on them when these do come up.  The sub and superclass idea especially is interesting to me - I didn&rsquo;t know that classes could inherit methods from other classes.  It will be interesting to see how I interact with the information presented in the book in a second pass through later on once I have a better grasp of these concepts.  As much as I learned this time, I think it will be even more useful next time with a little more knowledge and experience under my belt.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that the first week of Sales Engine is wrapped up, I&rsquo;m feeling in a better place now than the first few days.  Starting out the project by looking over the specs, it was daunting but I kept my stress relatively low by reminding myself that we a) have a week and a half to complete the project and b) will be taking this one little baby step at a time.  I was also excited to try out programming with MiniTest - I knew that forces you to take little bites in your coding.  I worked with my partner, Shane, to map out how the baby steps we&rsquo;d need to take to complete the project in Pivotal Tracker, and was ready to get to work.</p>

<p>Once it came to the actual coding, we didn&rsquo;t get off to a strong start.  The first night of the project, we loaded all the files in their respective classes, but soon found out the next morning we were loading them incorrectly for this project - we were drawing on the type of loading we did in Event Reporter, and for this project, each CSV row needed to be an instance of an object.  Both Shane and I thought we had learned enough from previous projects to get this one started on our own, but we really struggled to get the files loaded properly and relied on a lot of help from classmates and Katrina.</p>

<p>After a day extreme frustration and self-doubt, yesterday we were able to actually make some progress with search capabilities and starting on relationships in search functionality across objects.  At this point we&rsquo;ve relied less on our instructors for input, and have asked small questions of our classmates when needed, but the logic of this part of the project is making sense to me.  I may have some questions on implementation, but logically I feel sound.  Now that I&rsquo;m getting the hang of things, I&rsquo;m also enjoying MiniTest and my rainbow dots of goodness when all my tests pass.  It might take a little longer to code with Minitest, but it&rsquo;s really helpful to make sure your code works straight away and make little tweaks if needed.  I do believe I&rsquo;m being trained Pavlovian style to feel elation when I see rainbow colored dots.</p>

<p>I would have never thought my biggest roadblock would be loading the damned files, but here we are.  It&rsquo;s one of those things that I couldn&rsquo;t formulate on my own, but now that I look at the code, I think I&rsquo;m making sense of it correctly, but I will probably still work on talking through it with some of the more experienced classmates or instructors to make sure I have it down before continuing to our next project.  To me, even if the code is correct, there&rsquo;s no sense in handing in a project with the code unless I understand it, or I&rsquo;m not going to learn anything or progress in upcoming projects.</p>

<p>So far, I feel relatively good about going forward with the relationship portion of the project, and I&rsquo;m hoping that business intelligence is also not much of a logical or logistical roadblock for me.  The biggest thing I want to work on right now is studying up on when I would use certain techniques, because that&rsquo;s still kind of confusing for me - when would I use an instance method or class method?  When is it best to use an instance variable?  Hash versus array?  Once I see someone&rsquo;s code, I can usually make sense of it, but I get tripped up in writing it myself and making the decision to use this over that.  Honestly though, that&rsquo;s the same way I&rsquo;ve been with any language.  When I was learning French or Japanese, I could read it all right, but when it came to speaking it myself, it took a while for actual sentences to come out instead of misplaced or mispronounced words and incorrect grammar.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting experience working in a pair, too.  I&rsquo;m not sure where I would be with this project if I was working on it independently.  It seems like Shane and I had the same stumbling blocks and for the most part are at the same level with what we&rsquo;re understanding and what&rsquo;s confusing to us.  I know a few of the pairs are groups where one partner is a lot stronger than the other in their current knowledge level and comfort with implementation, but I think Shane and I were pretty well matched.  It is interesting in a pair - I find myself focusing on &lsquo;Am I doing too much of this myself?  Does it seem like I&rsquo;m trying to control our pair, and am I making him feel like he&rsquo;s being cut out?&rsquo;  I think I&rsquo;ve been a little more vocal on when we need help and I&rsquo;m used to managing a team from my previous job, so I&rsquo;m trying not to make it feel like I&rsquo;m managing our team - I want it to be an equal partnership.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve only been in gSchool only three weeks - it feels like it&rsquo;s been far longer.  One of the questions to reflect on is whether I feel like a developer yet, and I can&rsquo;t say that I do.  I am still really frustrated that I couldn&rsquo;t start a project like this without significant help, and I feel like I&rsquo;m behind where I should be in class.  I&rsquo;ve been studying independently but everything we&rsquo;re supposed to know hasn&rsquo;t quite clicked yet.  I am hoping that &lsquo;a-ha!&rsquo; moment comes soon, but even once it does, I think I&rsquo;ll still feel like I&rsquo;m learning to become a developer.  Hopefully somewhere down the road in this course I&rsquo;ll feel like I can confidently say I am, and I also realize it&rsquo;s not a function of being &lsquo;done learning&rsquo;.  I&rsquo;ve never met a single developer who hasn&rsquo;t been learning something new or expanding on their knowledge, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be any different.  So what&rsquo;s the tipping point of knowing enough that I feel like a developer?  I&rsquo;m not sure, but I am looking forward to that point.</p>
