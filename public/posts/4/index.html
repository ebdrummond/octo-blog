  <div class="entry-content"><p>Upon completion of The Passionate Programmer, there were a few overarching themes that I took from the book.  The first was to be curious - don&rsquo;t just stagnate in the programming language(s) that you know or the technologies that you&rsquo;re used to, but continually strive to learn new languages and new skills.  This helps you to prepare for the future, as most languages come and go and you will have a backup, but also helps you draw from a larger pool of knowledge to implement the best solutions for each project.  Coupled with this is the advice to take smart risks, especially with the &lsquo;bleeding edge&rsquo; of technology - at best, you&rsquo;ll establish yourself in the next big thing, and at worst you&rsquo;ve picked up a new skill set that has exercised your mental muscle.</p>

<p>Although I think my generation has thoroughly internalized this message, Chad also urges readers to be proactive about their career.  There is not an expectation anymore that anybody is going to go work for a company for 40 years until they retire, so you must be focused on preparing for the future (without, of course, looking so hard at the next step all the time that you neglect to embrace your job in the moment).  This goes back partially to point number one, in learning new marketable skills if your language of choice becomes obsolete, but also requires that you define yourself outside of your current employment and take care to market yourself well.  Especially with the tech community being so dependent on your network, cultivating relationships is necessary, whether through &lsquo;making the hang&rsquo; with people you admire or cultivating mentor/mentee networks.</p>

<p>Lastly, this book was named The Passionate Programmer for a reason - you have to love what you&rsquo;re doing to be a good programmer.  If you lack a passion for what you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re probably not going to want to put in the extra work that is needed to get the most out of this career path.  Although anyone should be pursuing work that they love, good programmers are always learning new skills and pushing themselves forward, and it shows in the quality of your work if you don&rsquo;t have that love of programming.</p>

<p>I also liked one of the tips in part V, Better Than Yesterday, in relation to gSchool.  I&rsquo;ve been somewhat critical of myself this past week in that my skills are not yet as good as I want them to be (which I do realize is crazy to be this hard on myself in that as of a month ago, I had never touched a command line outside of Word Perfect).  I can sometimes be critical of myself, and I need to embrace taking things a day at a time, focusing on what I can do each day to make the day better than the day before instead of worrying about where I&rsquo;ll be six months from now.  It&rsquo;s easy to look at any large task as daunting and feel overwhelmed or, even worse, immobilized.  Taking it day by day, as long as you&rsquo;re honestly able to answer that you did something to make the day better than yesterday, should be a big help in making it seem more manageable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Monday earlier this week we were assigned a project to work on, Event Reporter, to test our individual mastery of the basic Ruby we have learned so far.  The project we built was designed to prompt the user through the terminal to enter a defined set of commands, and manipulate data from a CSV file of registerees data from an event.  For example, if the user entered load file, our default registeree CSV should load, which the user could then use to look up, for example, how many people registered from zip code 80203.  The tool should store the user&rsquo;s search until a new search was performed, and the user would be able to view their selected search output from the terminal or save it to a new CSV.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I came down with a nasty cold on Tuesday and left early that day, staying at home through the duration of the project.  Because of this, my workflow from Tuesday onward was pretty solitary.  On Monday I used my time to talk with classmates and recap my basic Ruby through re-doing the Pragmatic Studio videos to make sure that I had the fundamentals down, before structuring a basic outline of how I wanted the nuts and bolts of my program to work and basic methods I would create.  I&rsquo;ve found that just making a list in your code of the small steps you need to complete for each method is really helpful (and feels great to cross everything off one at a time!).  On Tuesday I worked with classmates to get their ideas of how they would start their projects prior to leaving, and powered through to work on the code Tuesday night, Wednesday day and night, and Thursday morning.  I wrote as much code as I could, and if I got really stuck on something that I couldn&rsquo;t find answers to in my videos, my intro to programming book, or StackOverflow, I would ask my husband, Brock (a PHP programmer) if he could guide me with questions I should be asking myself.</p>

<p>The finished product can be found here: <a href="http://github.com/ebdrummond/gschool_event_reporter">github.com/ebdrummond/gschool_event_reporter</a></p>

<p>Overall, I was really glad that my code worked, as I was making tweaks to ensure it passed the base expectations up to about 45 minutes before the code was due.  It felt good to have it done and to have it work, but I know my code is not very strong.  A few lines of code exceed 80 characters and methods definitely need to be refactored so they&rsquo;re not so long.  I took a stab at refactoring a few of my longer methods in a backup file prior to submission, but could not get the code to run properly.  As I learn more Ruby skills I would like to go back and refactor my code, but overall I&rsquo;m pretty proud of it because before this program I literally had no programming knowledge at all.  The big thing I worry about is learning these skills better - I spent over 20 hours on this project and felt I struggled to do this on my own.  I would have preferred if my skills were strong enough that I didn&rsquo;t need so much help from teammates or Brock.  I plan to spend this weekend redoing some old projects to make sure I have a better grasp of them before launching into Sales Engine, our next project, next week.</p>

<p>The best takeaway from this project was taking small bites and not trying to tackle the entire beast at once.  Not only is this more technically manageable, but psychologically it gives you a boost and doesn&rsquo;t make it feel insurmountable.  For my next project, I hope to have my fundamentals down better so that I can build more quickly and have ample time for refactoring at the end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Be the worst.  This goes against everything most of us were taught, and puts us squarely outside of our comfort zone.  It can be intimidating to be in a group of people all more knowledgable than you are, and it&rsquo;s easy to second guess yourself if you happen to be the one that&rsquo;s less skilled than everyone else.  You&rsquo;re supposed to take every opportunity to shine (be it individually or as a group) and to show it, and I think most of us naturally like being in groups where we&rsquo;re comfortable in the knowledge that we&rsquo;re towards the top of the talent.  Be the worst is the tip that resonanted most strongly with me in reading the first half of TPP and I think it relates well to my next six months.  I knew gSchool was going to be a challenge and take me squarely outside of my comfort zone by pushing me every single day, but I would agree that 9 times out of 10, this is where you&rsquo;re going to get your most serious development and experience.  Especially if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to be in an environment where those around you are helpful and willing to lend a hand, there&rsquo;s no reason not to be the worst.</p>

<p>A tip that has surfaced from my past experiences is that it&rsquo;s always a good idea to get to know how your business works.  This sounds simple, but at my last job, the business was fairly huge (1,000 of us in DC alone) and it was difficult to know all the different parts of the business.  Many people complained that they felt siloed in our department, but didn&rsquo;t do too much about it.  Though it was a small step, I always took part whenever there was an opportunity to shadow another department in the company and did my best to attend presentations/workshop on what other business units did (side note: it was one of these workshops that really lit the spark for my interest in gSchool!).  Even when there didn&rsquo;t seem to be a ton of overlap between the department I was shadowing and my own, I always found at least some small tweak that I could make in my job to make it easier on the other department.  When I was promoted to manage the team I was a member of, I worked with two other managers in other departments to educate our teams on each others&#8217; roles.  This led not only to stronger working relationships between the teams, but cut duplicative efforts, saving everyone valuable time.  Even if you aren&rsquo;t able to completely wrap your head around the entire business if you work at a large company, I think it&rsquo;s always worth it to take even a small step outside of your own department.</p>

<p>When I was reading in part I of the book on becoming a generalist, I agreed with the sentiment but was reminded of a recent past experience that I thought put a little asterisk here as cautionary advice.  I just recently watched a friend passed up for a promotion she very much deserved because she knew and executed so much of what her department did that wasn&rsquo;t in her primary function that she would have been too difficult to replace - even when she left for vacation, her department visibly suffered.  In general I agree with this sentiment, and again don&rsquo;t think you can learn too much about an organization overall, but I do think it helps if you in turn help cultivate your knowledge throughout your organization and never make yourself so much of a generalist that you&rsquo;re irreplaceable in this way.  As Chad mentions later on in the book, especially on a team, it&rsquo;s never a good idea if your team couldn&rsquo;t replicate your work if they had to.</p>

<p>I think the tip I&rsquo;m going to struggle with for the next few months is learning new languages and processes (outside of the gSchool curriculum) due to a sheer lack of time.  Once I have completed the program, I think my focus will likely be on developing my Rails skills to take it to the next level, but long term I do think it&rsquo;s a good idea to diversify your portfolio of skills without attempting to be an expert in all of them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been quite the week, and I&rsquo;m ending it on a pretty fantastic note.  Before I get to the end though, let&rsquo;s talk about the beginning&hellip;</p>

<p>I came into gSchool with zero programming experience, and I knew it was going to be a steep learning curve because of this, but I was hoping I&rsquo;d pick everything up pretty quickly.  Before the course started, we were assigned a Ruby video course to work through.  I got about halfway through pretty much understanding what was going on and able to keep up with the exercises (although I wasn&rsquo;t fully grasping it as much as I wanted to), but about halfway through I hit a wall.  I looked through some online resources but decided to purchase Chris Pine&rsquo;s Learn to Program book after hearing feedback that it was a very basic, happy to hold your hand introduction to Ruby and to programming.</p>

<p>I went through the book throughout the week, but was still feeling very behind in class and still felt like things hadn&rsquo;t completely clicked, even with the video, the book, two projects, and our Ruby in 100 minutes intro in class combined.  Until this afternoon.</p>

<p>Yesterday I worked on a class project with an awesome classmate, Blair.  He was incredibly nice about explaining everything, letting me ask a ton of questions, and listening to me explain how the code we were writing would work, since I heavily needed his help and couldn&rsquo;t come up with it on my own but wanted to be sure I had the logic down.  I still felt very behind and decided to dedicate my weekend to re-doing Ruby in 100 minutes and the video course until I felt up to speed.  When I did Ri100m today, something clicked.  I can&rsquo;t really explain how amazing that feeling is, when you struggle with something and feel frustrated in your abilities, but then finally break through.  I&rsquo;m still going to go through the video course again this weekend to ensure I&rsquo;m up to speed, but I&rsquo;m going into the weekend feeling great.  Fingers crossed I am getting it enough to finish my weekend assignment without too much pain!</p>

<p>Beyond this I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed my first week at gSchool too.  Our first day doing improv pretty much all day was a great introduction and got everyone out of their shell straight away.  I&rsquo;ve been blown away by how amazingly nice everyone is, and how willing to help out the more advanced people in class are.  I&rsquo;ve had about a billion questions over the course of the week, and not once have I sensed any irritation from classmates, no matter how basic my question.  It&rsquo;s also been great to meet so many people here at Galvanize and hear what their companies are doing - the energy here is really amazing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to seeing what comes next.  Yes, I know it will be stressful and I know there will be plenty more times when things don&rsquo;t click as soon as I may want them to, but I can&rsquo;t wait to dive in!</p>
