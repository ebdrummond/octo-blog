  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ah - FeedEngine is in the books.  For some reason, this was a difficult project to get through, even though I loved what we were building.  It seems like we&rsquo;ve reached a point in the class where a lot of people are feeling burned out, and I think that impacted some of our team this project - we ended up dropping a lot of the functionality that I wanted to implement because we couldn&rsquo;t get through it all with the amount of work the group as a whole was putting in.</p>

<p>At the same time, I learned a lot from this project.  The two things I&rsquo;m happiest learning about are how to interact with external APIs (Kyle and I implemented the Instagram service, and I implemented the Foursquare service), and refactoring my code to extract logic from the views and controllers, and even the model.  For this, I have to thank Raphael.</p>

<p>An example of refactoring can be seen in our implementation of the logic relating to the user show page.  For this page, we needed to break a user&rsquo;s trips out into current trips, past trips, and upcoming trips, AND we needed to determine whether the trip was private AND we needed to determine, if the trip was private, if the current viewer was authorized to view the trip.  Sounds easy, right?  I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to be that horribly difficult, but it ended up being harder than I thought to implement all of this logic in one place.</p>

<p>The way I originally wrote this part of the code, I had current, past, and upcoming trips in the Trip model, and handled the logic for whether the current user could view each trip in the controller.  Raph put a stop to that.  We ended up extracting all of this logic into a UserShow class, which took in the current user and the user whose profile was being viewed, ran through each trip to see if it was private and if the current user had viewing rights, and then split the trips into their correct timeframe.  You can view the final implementation here: <a href="https://github.com/raphweiner/feed_engine/blob/master/app/lib/user_show.rb">github.com/raphweiner/feed_engine/blob/master/app/lib/user_show.rb</a></p>

<p>I also learned to place even more value on communicating with your team, especially when you&rsquo;re touching someone else&rsquo;s code.  There were a number of times that I pulled down master to build on code I had previously implemented, and found it had been refactored so much that I had to spend half an hour just figuring out what the heck it was now doing.  Worse, there were times files I had been working on were deleted or the refactoring broke the code I had originally written.  This was pretty frustrating for me, and I&rsquo;m even more aware now that if you&rsquo;re touching someone else&rsquo;s code, it&rsquo;s a great idea to work with them first.</p>

<p>Overall, I think our project is a good first step, but I wish it went further.  There&rsquo;s a lot more functionality I would like to build out and changes I&rsquo;d like to made to the front end to make it look sleeker as well.  I&rsquo;d link to the project, but Jeff is turning off the extra background workers he had provisioned, so the app will no longer work.  I&rsquo;m taking some time off between graduating gSchool and starting a job, so one thing I&rsquo;d love to do is to keep working on Kreepr and get it to a place I&rsquo;m happier with, with more features, more security and background logic, and a cleaner look.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also really excited to be starting our independent project next week.  I don&rsquo;t have 100% sign off yet, but I had talked to Katrina about my idea, and it sounds like I&rsquo;ll be able to do PART of it - my original idea is too large a project to do independently in 9 days.  What I&rsquo;m going to be doing is making a website for my sister, who is a massage therapist.  Once it&rsquo;s completely done, I&rsquo;d like to have functionality to let Meghan set her schedule with a base weekly schedule that autogenerates up to two months out, with the ability to go in and tweak individual days.  In addition to a confirmation e-mail when an appointment is scheduled and a reminder e-mail a day or two out, I&rsquo;d also like to implement text messaging a few hours before an appointment to remind the customer, and let them text back if they need to cancel the appointment.  I&rsquo;d like to integrate with Yelp to show her overall review count, and maybe recent reviews.  Lastly, I&rsquo;d like the ability to allow customers to pre-pay for individual massages or massage packages online, and allow Meghan to charge a cancellation fee for missed appointments.</p>

<p>One of the requirements for this project is to build an API and gem on our own, which I think fits in nicely with the scheduling component.  There are a few other gems out there that I found, but none of them have been maintained in the past year; I&rsquo;d also love if my gem would give back to the community so that other people can use it for their own projects as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to be doing this project, for a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>I think the building out the scheduling component will be a pretty difficult, and it&rsquo;s a challenge that I think will be extremely rewarding.</li>
<li>I really want to give this gift to my sister.  Not only is she basically one of the most wonderful, caring, compassionate people on the planet and I want to help her grow her business, she also hooks me up with free massages.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m really glad to be doing this project while I&rsquo;m in gSchool.  Since this is a site that will actually be used, security is a big concern and I want to be sure that everything is locked down.  It will be really good to have that second set of eyes from my instructors so they can let me know if there are any vulnerabilities that I overlooked.</li>
</ol>


<p>So, super excited to get cracking on that, but also, not going to lie - I&rsquo;m excited about the long weekend too!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we took a group trip up to Boulder to participate in Boulder Startup Week, and even though it meant sacrificing a work day which we really need for our project, I&rsquo;m so glad we went.  I met a ton of really awesome people, got to take a look around some really interesting companies, and saw a new side of Boulder that I hadn&rsquo;t explored yet.</p>

<p>We started the day with a visit to the Boulder office of LivingSocial, which is composed only of LS developers.  It was really interesting to go back though - even though it&rsquo;s so different from the DC office, it still had that LS feel - the funky furniture converted into conference tables, the white chairs with the weird arm rests that never stayed in place.  I talked to two guys who worked there, one who worked on front end for user acquisition, and one who worked on back end for the LS Amazon partnership, and it was really interesting to see what they were working on, especially since I still recognized a lot of it.  We then went to QuickLeft to talk to some people on the team there and take a look around the offices, which were also really cool - especially the herb garden they have growing in the landscaping right next to the kitchen!</p>

<p>After that I met up with my friend Lauren, who still works at LivingSocial in Seattle, who was a fly-in for startup week, Ashe Dryden, and my husband Brock for lunch, and we were joined by my instructor Franklin.  I&rsquo;ve followed Ashe on Twitter for a long time, and it was really great to meet her in person finally, and seeing Lauren again (I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d seen her since last September) was awesome.</p>

<p>After lunch we participated in the startup crawl and visited a bunch of different startups in the Pearl Street area.  There were so many amazing people we met, and I was really excited at how friendly and welcoming the whole community was, both the employees at the startups, and the other crawlers we met along the way.  There&rsquo;s so many people doing such diverse things, but everyone we met was really passionate about their work and the value they&rsquo;re bringing to their customers/clients.  I&rsquo;m so happy to be in this space; I feel like so many jobs are just that - just a job.  In the Ruby world, there&rsquo;s so much exciting stuff going on, and this really seems to be a community driven by passion.</p>

<p>I went to a Women in Tech dinner with Ashe, Lauren, and a few other people, and then we were off to Pivotal Labs for the Boulder Ruby Meetup.  Again, a ton of really engaging and passionate people there.  It&rsquo;s also really neat to have been to enough meetups at this point that I tend to see a lot of familiar faces and people to catch up with, and also meet new friends.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to be a part of this community and to be joining it as an employee soon.  I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re down to 9 weeks left in gSchool - it&rsquo;ll be over so soon!  I&rsquo;m really excited to see what I&rsquo;ll be doing next, but it looks like there&rsquo;s lots of interesting options out there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m not the happiest with middleman and want to address a few challenges, so I&rsquo;m creating a blog from scratch with Rails, hopefully without needing to reference the Blogger tutorial at all.</p>

<p>My challenges:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an attractive design to practice front end development and showcase a blog I can be proud to show off - I really don&rsquo;t like the current look of my blog, and especially as I&rsquo;m increasingly going to be showing it off to potential employers, I need to stand behind and be proud of my work.</li>
<li>Practice my Rails skills from soup to nuts.  I love working on teams, but it necessitates touching only part of the code.  This will be good practice for me to make sure I understand the process beginning to end, and it&rsquo;s great practice before our individual project in two weeks!</li>
<li>Most importantly, 100% of the code will be written in TDD.  Literally not one line of code will be written without a failing test.  I haven&rsquo;t always been the best about adhering to strict TDD, and I need to get better - I know firsthand why it&rsquo;s important, and no skill is going to magically appear; I need to practice it.</li>
</ol>


<p>So&hellip; wish me luck!  Hopefully you&rsquo;ll see a finished product I&rsquo;m proud to stand by in no time :)  The biggest challenge I&rsquo;m anticipating is just finding time to work on it with all the other projects I&rsquo;m working on, but honestly, since there&rsquo;s no firm deadline and I am going at my own pace, working on it so far has almost felt like a break from everything else.  It is a good feeling - programming can be tough, but even just the small amount of time I&rsquo;ve put in so far reminds me of how much I love to do it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The thing I&rsquo;m most excited about with my FeedEngine project is that once it&rsquo;s finished, I&rsquo;ll actually want to use it.  We&rsquo;re building a group travel blog that lets you integrate the Twitter, Instagram, and Foursquare activities for all travelers within a trip.  I really love to travel and usually am pretty poor about documenting my travels aside from taking pictures and posting them to Facebook when I get home, so this is a product I will actually use.  I&rsquo;m sure other people who want to document a group trip in this way would like to use it as well - although to be honest, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad product for just a solo trip either.</p>

<p>One thing I am going to be cautious on with this project is that from everyone I talked to at Hungry Academy, this was their hardest project.  We have three weeks to get it done, but I&rsquo;m conscious of how quickly that due date catches up to you.  One thing my team is doing is that we have some ideas in the back of our mind of functionality we would like to create, but we&rsquo;re not going to start building it at all until the base functionality is completed and we&rsquo;re sure we have the time to put into the extra features before the project is due - we&rsquo;re full assing a small set of features instead of half assing a large set.</p>

<p>For this project, I&rsquo;m working with another team member on the front end.  So far, I really haven&rsquo;t enjoyed working on the front end in projects - it feels tedious and mind numbing to me, so I&rsquo;ve tended to work on the back end, which I strongly prefer.  I&rsquo;m trying to take myself out of my comfort zone a little so that I can learn more of the front end, try to use some of the jQuery I learned, and just get the basics down.  As much as I really don&rsquo;t want a job focusing on front end development, the reality is that most jobs will touch it to some degree, and I want to know the basics for when that does happen.  I also feel pretty lucky in that this is part of the project I will probably be able to work with Brock on when I get stuck - we&rsquo;re far enough in Rails that he has no idea what&rsquo;s going on, so I haven&rsquo;t been able to work with him on questions, and that&rsquo;s one of the things I miss from when we were just learning Ruby.  It was fun to sit down and pair/troubleshoot with him, and I should be able to do that with him with the front end.  On the other hand, I&rsquo;m hoping to finish up the nuts and bolts of the front end so that I can do some of the back end code for this project as well.</p>

<p>Another thing that&rsquo;s on the back of my mind as we head nearer and nearer to graduation is finding a job once gSchool is complete.  If possible, I&rsquo;d really like to stick around in Denver; if I can&rsquo;t find anything here, Portland is at the top of my list.  Aside from geography, I&rsquo;m simultaneously nervous and excited about finding a company that&rsquo;s a good fit for me.  When looking at a company, one of the things that will be at the top of my list is finding a company that values ongoing learning for their newer hires.  I have learned so much in this program and still have 10 weeks left, but I know that I&rsquo;ll still have so much to learn and fine tune when I&rsquo;m done, and I want to be in an atmosphere that is understanding of that.  Also, just at a base level, I want to work with people I get along with and that communicate well.  I&rsquo;ve been in jobs where everyone gets in, puts their head down, no one talks to each other, and then you go home - that&rsquo;s a really awful environment.  I think there&rsquo;s a stereotype that that&rsquo;s what programmers do, but so far I&rsquo;ve found it to be completely untrue.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to work at a company that has a decent sized dev team - I&rsquo;m not yet comfortable enough in my skills that I feel ready to work at a small startup where I&rsquo;m one of two or three people writing code.  I&rsquo;d also really like to find a place that&rsquo;s laid back, where there is opportunity to move up with the company and work on more complex projects as my skills improve, and lets me draw on the soft skills I&rsquo;ve built up from my previous life before I started gSchool.  It&rsquo;s not the number one focus of mine, but I also am looking at a decent compensation package commensurate with my skills and the previous experience I bring with me.</p>

<p>From talking with others in the program, I think we&rsquo;re all a little nervous and very excited to see where we all end up in three months.  At the end of the day, I&rsquo;m going to value my intuition - when I interviewed with LivingSocial, I knew it was the right job for me at the time when my face hurt from smiling after I left the interview.  I can&rsquo;t put my finger on it, but it&rsquo;s this electric feeling where things just feel like they&rsquo;re the missing puzzle piece - that&rsquo;s what I want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Son of Store Engine was an interesting project for me.  I started off feeling a little shaky on my Rails knowledge versus Store Engine, and I still feel like I have a ton to learn, but towards the end of the project I felt like the struggle I put in started to pay off.  In the beginning of the project, I began to realize I wasn&rsquo;t ever really sure how my params were being passed back and forth, what the heck was in my session, how I could get information from point A to point B, and by the end, I felt like I understood these things better.  A huge part of this process was the better errors gem and information contained there by default, and in the live shell.  It was enormously helpful to be able to inspect params, what was in my session, and be able to play around in the live shell to manipulate this information to output what I needed.  We had used better errors in Store Engine, but I felt like I didn&rsquo;t know how to harness it&rsquo;s power to my advantage until the latter part of this project.</p>

<p>I also got the chance to put processor controllers and models into play for information that we wanted to render on one page, but involved four different forms and databases.  This was something I attempted to do last project and failed pretty miserably, but I had really wanted to try this project.  It took a little wrangling to get it, but I think the final result was pretty clean code and I&rsquo;m so glad I know how to do this now.  Here&rsquo;s a snippet:</p>

<p>Overall, I think our project wasn&rsquo;t great (there&rsquo;s a lot more I would have liked to do with a few extra days), but I think it was pretty good.  The final result is here: <a href="http://pink-sose.herokuapp.com/">pink-sose.herokuapp.com</a></p>

<p>It also feels weird to be at the halfway point of gSchool.  It feels like ages ago we were doing logic problems for warmups and getting stressed over Event Manager.  At the same time, it went by quickly with all we&rsquo;ve been doing, and I&rsquo;m hoping that July 19th comes as quickly as well.  My big hope for the second half of the program is that I can manage the stress a little better, and maximize my learning with the time I&rsquo;m putting in.  I&rsquo;ve been putting in about 12 to 14 hours a day during the weekdays on average, and 8 to 12 on weekends when we&rsquo;re working on a project.  At the same time, I feel like there&rsquo;s still so much that we&rsquo;re exposed to that I&rsquo;m not learning as well as I&rsquo;d like, and the physical exhaustion and frustration over all the things I haven&rsquo;t been able to pick up yet are taking their toll.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been quite the week.  We started Son of Store Engine, which takes code from our last project and adds on to it - but we can&rsquo;t sacrifice any of the functionality from the last project in reworking the code.  I am happy that we have a project like this and not everything is built from scratch.  The reality is that most everyone will be working with legacy code when we&rsquo;re done, and this is really good practice for me.  So far, I&rsquo;ve found it to be harder than building something from scratch in a lot of respects; I first have to understand what the code is doing (some of it is written in a style I&rsquo;m not used to).  Then, there have been a few times I&rsquo;ve built on top of something or tweaked something seemingly insignificant, and previous functionality has broken, so it&rsquo;s an extremely valuable lesson.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been really different in this project for me versus most other projects I&rsquo;ve worked on, at least so far.  Most of my last projects (Traffic Spy maybe excepted), I&rsquo;ve felt like I&rsquo;ve contributed a good percentage of the code base and functionality.  This project, what I&rsquo;ve worked on so far, it has felt like I haven&rsquo;t written as much code or functionality as I&rsquo;d like; it&rsquo;s been a tedious process for a lot of the functionality so far.  I&rsquo;m hoping that it speeds up some from here, but I will also try to keep in mind what Chad Fowler mentioned in our talk with him today - when working with legacy code, a lot of it can be tedious, and that&rsquo;s just how it is.  I&rsquo;m hoping I can also learn some common things to look for so I don&rsquo;t get so hung up spending time on what should be small fixes.  For example, I struggled for about an hour yesterday wondering why the functionality I wrote to remove a line item from a cart when the quantity was set to zero wasn&rsquo;t working.  Turns out quantity was being stored as a string and not an integer.  On the plus side, it felt damn good once I got that fix working!</p>

<p>On the last project, I felt relatively confident with Rails (although I still asked Kareem for help a good amount of times when I got stuck, which he was happy to provide), but I actually feel less confident with this project.  I think there&rsquo;s just more we&rsquo;re delving into with this project and I&rsquo;m picking this up more slowly.  One thing I really have enjoyed is since I have a lot more questions this time that can&rsquo;t really be answered within the team, I&rsquo;ve been reaching out more to &lsquo;real&rsquo; developers for an answer, and I&rsquo;ve found that in answering my question, they&rsquo;ve also taught me other things that I didn&rsquo;t even realize I didn&rsquo;t yet know.  I had what I thought was a quick question for Horace from LivingSocial last night, and in answering it, he taught me about custom routes for controllers beyond the 7 verbs, which actually fascinated me way more than my question.  I&rsquo;m also really looking forward to mastering the art of using a processor class so that I can have forms for multiple databases on one page; I tried that in my last project but we could only get the functionality working halfway, so we had to rip it out and never had time to implement it properly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also really looking forward to working with my mentor.  My first mentor had to back out do to time constraints, but I&rsquo;m set to work with my new mentor, Jim Denton, on Monday after class.  Jim works at Groupon, and I&rsquo;ve worked with him before to address questions as they&rsquo;ve come up in projects.  He&rsquo;s been super helpful when I&rsquo;ve worked with him in the past, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to working with him as a mentee.  I have a lot of general questions I want to ask (like the processor class), but it will also be really helpful to be able to bounce project ideas off of him and hopefully come up with solutions to problems I don&rsquo;t even know I have yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By far, Store Engine has been the most exciting project I&rsquo;ve worked on.  It was awesome to be able to show my friends and my family an actual site that I&rsquo;d built - somehow showing them all the awesome output from a command line just doesn&rsquo;t have the same pizzazz.  Not that I didn&rsquo;t work hard on my other projects too, but I felt like I pushed myself even harder for this project and poured myself into it very aggressively.  The final product is something I&rsquo;m really proud of and I think my team made a great effort.  It really meant a lot too that we were chosen to present our project as a group demo.  It felt so good that not only did we come together and learn a ton, feel like we could all feed proud of our finished product, but that other people recognized the hard work we put in, too.</p>

<p>Having worked on a real Rails project, I think I&rsquo;m ready to make some changes to the next project I have.  First off, while we started off thinking of what a customer would need to do and thought of the pages we would need, I think we got off track from there.  Next time, I&rsquo;d really like to focus on the customer experience and let that drive the development kind of from the outside in, and try to do TDD that starts with feature testing and flows down to the model testing instead of building up the model and working to feature testing.  I also am still getting a hang of how to most effectively use MVC to the fullest and most elegant extend - I feel like I was doing a lot of work in the view or controller.  I know that&rsquo;s not the best way to do things, but any time I tried to refactor everything blew up - of course most of what needed the most refactoring was what was built in the last few days of the project, so unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on it since we had to push to get the project completed.  For my next project I want to start out learning how to better assign the heavy lifting to the model and have it output correctly to the view instead of doing that work elsewhere.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also appreciating more than ever how awesome it is to try &lsquo;stretch work&rsquo; - there were a few times during the project that I tried to tackle something that was a bit out of reach of what I already knew how to do, instead of just sticking to the easy stuff that I had already done.  Some of the time I gave it my all and tried to find answers on my own, and when I couldn&rsquo;t my more knowledgeable teammate was more than happy to step in and help me to find a solution, but I appreciated the patience the group had to let me try to find a solution.  When I was able to find a solution on my own, it wasn&rsquo;t always the best code, but it got the job done, and that&rsquo;s what learning to refactor is for!</p>

<p>I think it will depend on the makeup of our next group, but I&rsquo;d like to look into different ways of making sure everyone has a good handle on how the code works without necessarily doing everything as a big group.  Given our group makeup this time, I think that was the best way forward, but I think you can split off into pairs working on different parts of a project without sacrificing knowledge of your code base.  Given how we approached the makeup of our group, I don&rsquo;t think we were actually a lot more productive than a pair of programmers would be.  We may have picked up maybe 25% extra efficiency, but we didn&rsquo;t double our output with double the programmers involved.</p>

<p>All in all, this week was exhilarating.  Our team came together and really hammered through the home stretch of our project, and I have done more outside of class to try to connect with the community.  I went to the Women Who Code event on Wednesday and met some really cool people, some newbies like myself and some women who have been in the industry for years.  It was also great to meet people at the Thoughtbot Drinkup - I finally feel like I have enough of a handle on programming that I can carry on a real conversation, whereas just a few weeks ago everything still had a tendency to feel like Greek to me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been thinking a lot lately on what I can do to get other women from non-tech backgrounds interested in programming.  I&rsquo;d like to volunteer for RailsBridge and talked to Desi of DevChix about that.  I wonder what else I can do to reach out to women who are intimidated by programming or think they can&rsquo;t do it - obviously the women at RailsBridge have committed to dipping their toes in the water, but I want to reach out to people who are at the place I was at a year go, when I thought my brain &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t work like that&rsquo; and that I&rsquo;d be really out of place with my background.  I&rsquo;m not sure what the best way to do that is, other than evangelizing to my friends and writing about my experience, and keeping an open door to other women who have questions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was interesting to read Don&rsquo;t Make Me Think - the examples could at times be pretty outdated, but the ideas behind all of the examples were still very relevant for today.  More so than even 10 years ago, people have an unbelieveably short attention span, and you really need to give a user instant gratification in your site or you will lose them.</p>

<p>(As a side note - It was also really entertaining to me to look at the examples and to remember how professional websites looked 10 years ago and laugh.  Granted, in my last job, we looked at a lot of websites from small businesses that were god awful and violated every principle in this book, but 10 years ago that was the case even for large companies.)</p>

<p>One of the ideas that really clicked with me is how users actually use the web versus what we might like to imagine - I thought it was spot on.  When I&rsquo;m on a site, I hardly ever look at the entire thing, just what I&rsquo;m specifically visiting the site to look for; once I&rsquo;ve found it, that&rsquo;s the end of the road.  This makes it even more important that users need to be able to navigate your site quickly, so intelligible design and naming conventions are key.  Part of keeping everything easy to navigate definitely includes cutting out words - they clutter the page and can make it harder to find what you&rsquo;re looking for.  Lots of text is also pretty easy to ignore - I sometimes find myself getting an error message on a site, and realizing I didn&rsquo;t read the text, precisely because it usually is so easy to ignore.</p>

<p>I also know it violates every rule of DRY, but from a user perspective, it&rsquo;s sometimes good to get to the same destination in three different ways (especially if a site does not have a search functionality).  Take Krug&rsquo;s chainsaw example - why not put that in multiple categories if it&rsquo;s reasonable that a user might look in those categories?</p>

<p>I think the lessons from this book tie in well to our Store Engine project.  We had consciously decided to make our site very clean looking with a lot of whitespace, so that the information on the site really stands out.  There&rsquo;s also very easy links throughout the site to different parts of the site, and an easy flow through to checkout.  To give credit where it&rsquo;s due, we did use bootstrap to help us, so a lot of the thought into the design happened before we touched it, but I think these are still really good principles to keep in mind, even if you are using pre-defined templates, to make sure they are still fulfilling your users&#8217; needs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think this week has been most interesting from the perspective of learning to work with others in new ways.  Both from the perspective of the increased emphasis on pairing and the larger groups, I feel I&rsquo;ve learned a lot.</p>

<p>To start, I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot out of the structured pairing we&rsquo;ve done.  I&rsquo;ve done pairing before, but the more structured environment is making me a better pair programmer.  If it&rsquo;s not structured, I feel like it&rsquo;s easy for one person or the other to take over, and not really do pairing.  The modified ping pong pairing has been good.  It&rsquo;s also been helpful to look at how other groups are approaching the questions of Store Engine, and take some of their awesome ideas or lessons they have learned, and incorporate them into our project.  The one trap that was easy to fall into though is discussing the project and talking about Well my group did this, and not doing enough coding, which I&rsquo;d like to avoid next time.  It&rsquo;s definitely helpful to have that conversation and I learned a ton, but I would really like to work on my core skills of coding in a pair.  I think it might almost be more helpful to not work on our actual projects but a dummy project; this way you avoid long discussions of project organization or implementation, and you&rsquo;re also not caught in an awkward point of your project that&rsquo;s difficult for someone who hasn&rsquo;t been working on it to jump into.</p>

<p>Working in a group of four has been a lot different from working in a pair for this project as well.  I knew the organization was going to be a little different and we&rsquo;d really have to make sure our communication was open to avoid duplicative work or systems that didn&rsquo;t interact together in the correct way, but it&rsquo;s also more of a challenge with project vision and meshing personalities as well - I hadn&rsquo;t really taken into account how difficult that aspect might be.  I definitely think we ended the week on a smoother note than we started it; I think after some team discussions everyone has a better appreciation that we are coming in with different skills and experience, but we&rsquo;re all a team and no one person makes decisions for everyone.  There&rsquo;s also been a deeper appreciation for, when there is a conflict in a direction we should go, having a respectful discussion of why we should go in a given direction, and coming to a consensus that way.  It might have been a little bumpy at first, but I think it&rsquo;s benefitted all of us - we&rsquo;re going to be in contact with a lot of different personalities and need to work in groups throughout our career, so it&rsquo;s great to learn how to work through that to deliver a quality project that everyone understands now.</p>

<p>In that vein, I&rsquo;ve really liked our group&rsquo;s vision from the get go that even if we&rsquo;re working more slowly than other groups, we&rsquo;re not moving on til everyone understands what&rsquo;s going on.  This has meant that we&rsquo;ve had several coding sessions where all four of us are in a conference room, hooked up to a TV.  Without question this has slowed the project down, but I would prefer that to having two people in the group not understand how a shopping cart is built and how the code works.  I don&rsquo;t know how feasible that is in the working world, but as we&rsquo;re learning, I think it&rsquo;s benefitted the group.  This seems like it&rsquo;s the trickiest part of the project though, and with this out of the way, I&rsquo;m thinking this weekend and next week we&rsquo;ll be able to get a lot of code out in pairs.</p>

<p>We still have a lot to do, but I think at the end of the day we&rsquo;ll deliver a quality project.  I&rsquo;m really excited to see this all come together and to celebrate as a team.</p>

<p>So far, Rails has been interesting.  I&rsquo;m getting over my initial shock of how much it does for you on the back end, but I still feel like we&rsquo;re not done getting acquainted.  There&rsquo;s still a lot of code I look into, and I ask Wait, where is that method coming from?, to find out Oh, that&rsquo;s a Rails thing.  So there&rsquo;s still a lot to learn, but I like the structured nature of REST, and I&rsquo;m really enjoying learning the Capybara testing.  My big complaint is that I don&rsquo;t think (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong) there is rspec pride for Rails.  Somehow testing is just plain better when you see those fabulous little rainbow dots.</p>

<p>I also wonder how much my feelings will change when we get into the relational component of our project and the different roles of admin, regular user, and unregistered guest.  Stay tuned, but I&rsquo;m hoping this won&rsquo;t be too terrible in terms of either understanding it or implementing it.  The addition to our team of someone who is experienced with Rails and knows how the parts work has definitely been helpful though when there are questions; no one can ever say they didn&rsquo;t get a thorough explanation.</p>

<p>The biggest thing I&rsquo;m trying to absorb is how all everything works so I can extract it to different contexts.  The first few Ruby projects we worked on, I felt like I understood how everything worked in the confines of the project, but trying to apply that knowledge to something new just didn&rsquo;t translate well, which to me says I didn&rsquo;t really learn it fully.  I really want to build an amazing site for my sister, whether it&rsquo;s a project I can work on for school or something I do afterwards, and of course I want to have a firm grasp on what I&rsquo;m doing when I am employed afterward, so I&rsquo;m trying to focus on that when I&rsquo;m learning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week was the first time I was introduced to Rails with the Blogger project.  Having programmed in Ruby so far, it was very different to me, especially with respect to how much Rails automatically does for you.  It makes it really helpful that you&rsquo;re not writing a ton of finder methods, joining tables, or having to define a create method, but at the same time the level to which Rails is hands off feels really foreign to me still.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll feel more acquainted in no time (Ruby felt the same way at first).  It also felt really weird how little &lsquo;classical&rsquo; Ruby we wrote for blogger, and how empty the models were.  Before I started this project, not knowing Rails, I couldn&rsquo;t understand how people could even attempt to be a Rails developer without knowing Ruby, but now I can see why someone might think they could hack it (although I would not recommend it).</p>

<p>It was also interesting to look at the difference between Sinatra and Rails.  In Sinatra, I felt like it was a good middle ground between Ruby and Rails - you still had a lot of responsibility in your hands and were still writing a ton of &lsquo;classical&rsquo; Ruby very manually.  All in all, even though it might feel more comfortable right now, I think I would stick with learning more Rails.  Rails takes a lot of the work out of your hands, and it especially sounds like security is built in to Rails in a way that doesn&rsquo;t come close in Sinatra.  I also really want to become better acquainted with MVC and RESTful development in Rails, so I probably won&rsquo;t use Sinatra much - I don&rsquo;t want anything to get muddled in my mind right now.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re one-third of the way through class already.  It simultaneously feels like we&rsquo;ve been here for a really long time, but that really long time has flown by in the blink of an eye.  I&rsquo;m still amazed at how much I&rsquo;ve learned in just two months, and I really am excited to see what we&rsquo;ll be doing in the next four.  I remember thinking a month ago Oh god, what am I going to do for my midway project??  I don&rsquo;t know enough to do that!  I&rsquo;m beginning to feel more confidence in myself and my abilities, and now seeing all that&rsquo;s possible in Rails, I think I&rsquo;ll be able to come up with something interesting.  My first thought is making a website for my sister - she&rsquo;s a recently licensed massage therapist and always gives me free massages; I&rsquo;d love to pay her back by building her a site to help her grow her business.  I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be skilled enough by then (I think so), but I&rsquo;d love to build her a site that at least has a booking portion and a blog portion, and maybe an option to pre-pay for massages or packages.</p>

<p>So, the oft-asked question.  Do I feel like a developer yet?  Almost.  Kind of.  I feel like once I get through this Store Engine project, I will feel a lot closer.  I want to make sure I really do understand Rails once I don&rsquo;t have a tutorial prompting me every step of the way.  I also really want to get better at CSS and basic design - I understand what&rsquo;s going on when I read the HTML &amp; CSS book and try simple exercises on my own, but when I try to put that together in, for example, this blog, it kind of falls apart.  I think part of my respecting the Friday this week will be taking in a Railscast on Bootstrap.  But I do feel like once I have the basics on Rails and design down, I will feel like a very junior junior-level developer.  There&rsquo;s still so much to learn during gSchool (and beyond!), but I&rsquo;ll have some core skills to draw on, and a concrete site I can show to people.  Now am I ready for the big time, jumping in to help build something, say, for a thoughtbot client?  No, but I&rsquo;m getting there!</p>

<p>Speaking of thoughtbot, that was one of the highlights of my week.  It was really interesting to hear Ben talk about working with clients, how they approach projects, an the structure and approach of their organization.  I&rsquo;m still not sure what exactly I&rsquo;d like to do when I graduate, but the consultancy business sounds pretty interesting.  You get to work on a bunch of different projects for a short to medium period of time, and you get to interact with the clients (which I suppose can be a blessing or a curse, depending on the client).  This is something I was interested in when I started gSchool - a lot of tech people are really bad at explaining things to non-tech people, and I&rsquo;d love to be a part of bridging that gap.</p>

<p>I was also really interested in learning more about the apprenticeship program in Stockholm.  I would love to get a full time job out of gSchool, but if for some reason I feel like I&rsquo;d like to continue my formal learning for a little longer or I&rsquo;m not finding something as quickly as I&rsquo;d like, I would love to look into apprenticing at thoughtbot.  Thoughtbot sounds like a wonderful environment with really passionate programmers, and Stockholm would be wonderful - it&rsquo;s always been my long term goal to hone my skills, get experience under my belt, and try to find a job in Europe somewhere down the road; maybe this could just accelerate that plan!</p>
