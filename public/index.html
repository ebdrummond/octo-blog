  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to get this out in some way or another for a while, but wasn&rsquo;t really sure the best way to go about doing so. Now that I&rsquo;m at the point where I&rsquo;m moving again (per usual), I figure it&rsquo;s time to get this out in the open so I don&rsquo;t get weird looks and make people feel awkward when they ask a question and find out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Brock and I are divorcing. (Phew - there, it&rsquo;s out.)</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;ve told people this, I&rsquo;ve gotten a few common questions, so for the sake of not having to retell the same story 100 times, I figure I&rsquo;d answer some of the questions here.</p>

<p><strong> Q: What??! </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> Yep. Not an early April Fool&rsquo;s joke, I promise.</p>

<p><strong> Q: But I just saw you guys { insert your not so long ago time here } ago and you seemed great! </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> Well, that&rsquo;s not really a question (cheater), but I&rsquo;m sure we did seem fine. Things haven&rsquo;t been going well for quite some time, but through all of it we were still friends so I&rsquo;m sure we looked like we were enjoying each others&#8217; company; we probably were. But I guess that was part and parcel of the problem - we&rsquo;d become just friends.</p>

<p><strong> Q: I&rsquo;m so sorry! </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> Again, not a question. But don&rsquo;t be sorry - while the fact our relationship went this way sucks, I&rsquo;ve been happier in the past few months than I&rsquo;ve been in years. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve felt this alive since I first moved to DC almost eight years ago. I haven&rsquo;t talked to him too often in the past few months, but Brock seems to be happier now than he had been as well.</p>

<p><strong> Q: Wait, so what&rsquo;s going on with you two now? Are you living apart? </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> We started a trial separation last fall and spent the first two months with zero contact to give ourselves space to recenter ourselves and figure out what we individually wanted. Brock moved out of the coach house, and I stayed there with Lola May and got a roommate. After our two months of no contact was up, we met in person at our therapist&rsquo;s place and talked about what we wanted and where to go from there. It was very emotional to see each other again, and there was some back and forth over email for the next few weeks over whether to give it another go or to move towards divorce. Long story short, we both realized we were holding on to a fantasy of what we wanted us to be, and when we looked at reality, we realized it just wasn&rsquo;t working and it was time to let go.</p>

<p><strong> Q: How did this happen? </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> Lots of little things gradually added up, and we both have thoughts about different factors that caused this. I&rsquo;m not going to go into specifics, but for me a big part of it was that at a certain point I began to feel the distance growing between us, which over time kicked off a depressive episode. The distance made the depression worse, which widened the distance; they just fed off each other in a downward spiral, with a bunch of little things on top of it.</p>

<p><strong> Q: Well, he&rsquo;s an asshole if he&rsquo;s throwing in the towel! </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> I know people mean well and are trying to root for me or cheer me up by vilifying Brock, but it seriously doesn&rsquo;t help and is not reflective of reality; in fact we&rsquo;ve joked that in some ways this process would have been easier if the other person was a piece of shit because it would be much more black and white. Did Brock do things that were shitty during our marriage? Yep, he sure did. But guess what - so did I. Neither of us did anything to purposefully hurt the other person or tried to be a dick. There weren&rsquo;t any affairs or abuse or anything like that. We had garden variety moments of shittiness, but we were both doing the best we could with the tools and resources we had at the time. The decision to divorce is a conclusion we both came to independently at our own pace; neither one of us is abandoning the other.</p>

<p><strong> Q: But why aren&rsquo;t you two working through it? </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> Like I said, things had been bad for a while, and we had been in couples therapy for about a year. It wasn&rsquo;t getting any better, both of us felt pretty beat down from trying so long to make it work, and we were at the point where I think we would have permanently damaged the prospect of continuing a friendship if we had gone on much longer. Now that we&rsquo;ve had plenty of time apart (we&rsquo;ve only seen each other in person four times since we separated), I can see quite a few reasons why I don&rsquo;t think we would have worked in the long run no matter what. I&rsquo;m not going to hash that out here, but I will say this whole process has hammered on home how much you&rsquo;re fucking over your relationship and yourself if you don&rsquo;t communicate openly and honestly. You can&rsquo;t hide from your emotions or unpleasant situations - they will come up eventually, and the longer you ignore them, the harder it will be to deal with when they do come to the surface.</p>

<p><strong> Q: Wow. This must be terrible to go through. </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> Not something I&rsquo;d love to do every weekend, but it hasn&rsquo;t been so bad, all things considered. There were some patches that were incredibly rough emotionally, especially towards the beginning, but the past few months I&rsquo;ve found peace and acceptance. We talked through a rough draft of the divorce agreement over a nice bottle of cider, and there aren&rsquo;t really any points of contention. We don&rsquo;t own property, never shared bank accounts or credit cards, don&rsquo;t have kids to worry about, so knock on wood, this should not be a very difficult divorce process legally, considering what we&rsquo;ve seen other people go through. We&rsquo;re even on the same page about custody of the dog.</p>

<p>We also still care about each other very deeply as friends and we both want each other to be happy. Neither one of us is out for blood, and we&rsquo;d like to remain friends. This also makes things easier for you, as you don&rsquo;t have to feel pressured to choose a side.</p>

<p><strong> Q: So when is the actual divorce happening? </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> After I move and get settled in, I&rsquo;ll be starting the legal process.</p>

<p><strong> Q: How the hell are you so zen about this? </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> Lots of therapy, lots of self-reflection, lots of time spent with amazingly supportive friends and family, and lots of hard work in working through the issues I brought to the relationship. Not going to lie - there have been times it&rsquo;s been extremely painful, but I&rsquo;ve uncovered and am working through hurts that I&rsquo;ve been carrying around since way before Brock. Like I said before, emotions that you&rsquo;re trying to hide or have repressed will come up eventually, but meeting them head on and working towards a resolution feels pretty damned fantastic.</p>

<p><strong> Q: Do you regret getting married then? </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> Absolutely not. While we didn&rsquo;t end up working out as a married couple, we shared many wonderful times together and made a ton of memories that mean a lot to me. I&rsquo;m incredibly thankful for everything Brock has brought to my life and for the time we shared together - he wasn&rsquo;t just a husband, but a best friend. I have learned so much through this whole process, both the marriage and the divorce, and it&rsquo;s made me a better person. Besides, I follow the philosophy that I would never go back and change my past, even the painful parts or things I&rsquo;ve done that I&rsquo;m not so proud of - I wouldn&rsquo;t be who I am and where I am today without everything I&rsquo;ve been through. And for the first time in a long time, I can say I&rsquo;m really rather happy with who and where I am.</p>

<p><strong> Q: So what are you going to do now? </strong> <br>
<strong> A: </strong> Hit restart - it really is never too late.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the 7+ years since I&rsquo;ve left college, the longest I&rsquo;ve lived in one apartment is two years; I lived longer in my college apartment.  On Monday I move into my eighth place.  It feels like a lifetime ago I moved into my first place after leaving Michigan, a shared house in Petworth, DC where my room was so tiny I had to push the mattress to the other side of the bed frame to open the drawers of my dresser.  I paid more for that room than I did for my 850 square foot apartment in East Lansing.  I didn&rsquo;t care.  I was so excited to start my life, discover the city, figure out who I was without the crutch and comfort of my friends or my family.  It was a new adventure.</p>

<p>Compared with what we have now, I didn&rsquo;t have a lot back then; a few pieces of furniture, clothes, pots, pans, dishes.  A lot more of my college apartment joined me in DC when Brock and I moved in together six months after the move to DC.  I&rsquo;ve been moving these possessions around with me each move.  I&rsquo;m fairly confident I could guide anyone through reassembling our futon in my sleep.</p>

<p>Inevitably, we acquired new belongings in each new apartment.  Our apartment now includes an impressive variety of furniture from Ikea or Craigslist and years of purchases from Bed Bath and Beyond for each new apartment.  We got a dog a few years in, and I learned one needs a surprising amount of stuff for a 13 pound furball.  New clothes, new books (I&rsquo;m still mad at myself for selling most of my books back in my freshman year of college, and have never gotten rid of a book since), new furniture, new electronics.  We keep moving to bigger places, and always somehow manage to acquire stuff to fill the extra spaces.</p>

<p>And each move, I&rsquo;ve purged things I no longer needed or wanted.  Bags and bags of clothes, a TV, backpacks, houseplants, and lawn furniture are just a snippet of my stuff that&rsquo;s floating around out there somewhere, maybe still being used by their new owners, not to mention the pure junk I just threw away.  On the whole we tend to have more stuff with each move than what we started with, but it helps to keep the growth in check.</p>

<p>But this move feels different from the others.  It somehow feels more consequential than the move from DC to Denver to start a whole new career and leave everything I&rsquo;d built up behind.  As I was packing tonight, I realized that even through seven previous rounds of purges, I&rsquo;d kept a ton of unused things from my college years.  I found a number of shirts and a pair of shoes I&rsquo;d bought to pick up guys in the bars and clubs during my study abroad at Cambridge.  Jewelry from body piercings long healed shut.  Years of accumulation of eye shadow and lipstick even though I haven&rsquo;t even put on mascara in almost two years and hardly wore more than that after graduation.  Perfume from various trips to Europe during high school and college that have been untouched for years.  The University of Cambridge hoodie I was so proud of and couldn&rsquo;t bear to part with over a decade after I said goodbye to Gonville and Caius.</p>

<p>With the exception of one bottle of perfume, it&rsquo;s all gone now.  I don&rsquo;t know if I kept all of it for so long because I had really thought I&rsquo;d use it again, or if it was just a reminder of the life I used to have.  Either way, it&rsquo;s time to let go and move on.</p>

<p>Especially after getting rid of the sentimental remnants that I really only look back on when moving, I&rsquo;m struck by how little I use most of our possessions on a daily basis, and how much less of that I really need to be &lsquo;mine&rsquo;.  As long as I have my clothes, my computer, my toiletries, and my medications, there&rsquo;s not much else I really need that has to be mine.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s turning 30 in less than a month and realizing that my window of time for all the adventures I still want to have in life is narrowing, maybe it&rsquo;s realizing my marriage has slowly turned into a friendship that&rsquo;s at a shit or get off the pot moment, maybe it&rsquo;s frustration with where I&rsquo;m mentally, emotionally at right now, but I feel like I&rsquo;m at a turning point.  I&rsquo;m scared shitless not knowing where Brock and I will be six months from now and filled with anxiety that I didn&rsquo;t do enough with my 20s.  It feels like the end of something big, and the beginning of something big; the path just hasn&rsquo;t been fully laid yet.  No matter what happens, I&rsquo;m determined to leave the past in the past, and start this next stage in life as a new adventure I fully intend to make the most of.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5>Ingredients</h5>

<ul>
<li>1 heaping tsp coconut oil*</li>
<li>1 &frac12; tsp protein powder**</li>
<li>1 &frac12; heaping cups frozen fruit</li>
<li>Rice milk</li>
</ul>


<p>Go nuts with what kinds of fruit you want and try different pairings.  Peaches, mangoes, berries, cherries&hellip; it&rsquo;s all good.</p>

<h5>Instructions</h5>

<p>Put coconut oil, protein powder, and fruit in a blender (I prefer to use an immersion blender in a sturdy mixing beaker).  Pour in rice milk until it fills in the cracks between pieces of fruit.  Blend.  Enjoy.</p>

<p>* Just in case I am not the only one who didn&rsquo;t realize what coconut oil was - it&rsquo;s not a liquid, it&rsquo;s a solid.<br>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I&rsquo;m five weeks down at Table XI.  It still boggles my mind that a year ago, switching careers to become a developer wasn&rsquo;t even on my radar yet, and here I am now, shipping a big push to production on my first project at my first programming job.</p>

<p>I started at Table XI on September 9th, and spent my first few days exploring the code base I&rsquo;d be working on and helping to squash stray bugs.  The first few days were pretty stressful - I didn&rsquo;t understand a lot of the code base, and one of the first big bugs I had was in the javascript, which I still don&rsquo;t understand very well.  My mentor had told me my first few days, I&rsquo;d feel like I was in left field but it would pass quickly, but I had a hard time taking it to heart and felt I should be contributing more quickly.  I started to feel better when I talked to other people and heard how long it took them to ramp up when they first start a job - weeks and even months, even if they were experienced developers.</p>

<p>I rounded out the end of my first week attending Windy City Rails.  I&rsquo;d really wanted to go, but thought that since it was my first week, I didn&rsquo;t want to push it asking Table XI if I could take the time off to go.  The day I was moving out of my apartment in Denver, I got an email that they were sending me, so I was really excited.  It ended up being an awesome conference - I met a ton of people from companies around the Chicago area, the greater Midwest, and beyond, and the talks were really interesting.  I was pretty surprised how much I was able to pick up - a few of the talks were over my head, but I was able to take something concrete away from most of them.  It was also great to be able to get to know the Chicago Rails community so soon after moving here - I found it to be a very welcoming community, and I also had the chance to meet with other women in Chicago who had recently graduated from programs similar to gSchool, so it was great to talk to them and share stories.</p>

<p>Week two at Table XI, in addition to squashing bugs, I started to work on my own stories, and even had some deployed to production.  I was still feeling pretty nervous at the beginning of the week, but by week&rsquo;s end, I was starting to build my confidence when I realized that I was able to contribute on my own.  I think the biggest lesson that week for me, though, was not feeling bad about asking questions or being embarrassed about admitting I didn&rsquo;t know how to do something.  As my technical mentor brought up later, I was very honest about my skill level when interviewing, and they knew they were bringing in a junior developer that would require some training - I didn&rsquo;t have to apologize or feel guilty that I didn&rsquo;t know everything from day one.</p>

<p>The company has been great to work for - everyone has been extremely supportive and happy to help in whatever way they can.  I have a technical mentor that I&rsquo;ve been working with closely on my current project, Noel Rappin, and he has been wonderful at explaining complex ideas and answering the million questions I&rsquo;ve had.  I&rsquo;ve become a lot more comfortable asking not just Hey, I don&rsquo;t know how to do this, can you help?, but also Hey, I can get this to work but it&rsquo;s probably not the best way.  Can you show me how you would approach this?  Any other developer at the company that I&rsquo;ve asked for help, regardless of whether they touch my project at all, has been willing to help me out with a question, or even for extended pairing.</p>

<p>I have loved the project manager, Jen Mozen, I&rsquo;ve been working with too.  We work with Pivotal Tracker, and she&rsquo;s awesome at putting in all the information us developers will need, and clarifying any questions we have.  She is amazing at getting to the heart of what a client wants by asking the right questions and knowing their needs, as well as being forthright with what the development team will be able to accomplish in the given time parameters.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working closely with Jen during my onboarding process, and I have to say - I&rsquo;ve never worked anywhere with as thorough an onboarding process and as clear a commitment to making sure their employees are happily adjusting to their new job.  The best part of the onboarding process has been the bi-weekly check-ins, as well as this big board of sticky notes where I wrote down what I want to accomplish in the next six months, and Jen did the same for what Table XI would like to see me accomplish in that timeframe.  It runs the gamut from walking the dog ten miles per week to mentoring other developer-in-training students to learning more about application security and performance speed.  In our check-ins we look at my goals, talk about where I am on them,  see what I can do to get to the rest of my goals, and what the company can be doing to help me.  It&rsquo;s very clear they really care about their team, and it&rsquo;s been a good feeling as I settle into my new career.</p>

<p>The past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve continued to work on new stories for my project, and while we&rsquo;ve pushed up to production continuously, the first big feature push that I&rsquo;ve been working on since I started was this past Friday.  It&rsquo;s only been five weeks, but it feels a world different from when I started.  I understand the code base much better, and know the little quirks that run through it and how things interconnect.  I feel better about my skills, and more comfortable with knowing when to look something up on my own versus when to ask for help or to pair up to tackle a problem.  I&rsquo;d love to show you what I worked on, but most of it is on the admin side - trust me though, the code is super sexy (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/rodchile">Rodrigo Garcia</a>, who taught me code is sexy).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also participated in an inception with a new client, where we worked with the client during an all-day session to understand what the client needs, scope the criteria of the project, draw up some wireframes, and really just start to understand how we can bring the client&rsquo;s vision to life.  One of the reasons I wanted to work with a consultancy was to help code other people&rsquo;s dreams into reality, so it was a great experience to be there at the beginning with someone who will hopefully become a client, and I&rsquo;m really excited about the project.</p>

<p>Overall everyday life at Table XI has been great.  It&rsquo;s a pretty laid back environment, with a lot of perks.  We have an office chef that cooks fantastic meals for lunch every day, there&rsquo;s a company-sponsored Starbucks run every afternoon, there are flexible hours, and an amazing rooftop that&rsquo;s perfect for company-sponsored movies - I caught the last one of this season, Spaceballs.  They are also very committed to being involved with the local community, and are hosting Girl Develop It meetups and supportive of me mentoring Dev Bootcamp students.  Coming up is a dodgeball tournament with other tech companies in Chicago.</p>

<p>So yeah&hellip; that&rsquo;s been my first five weeks in a nutshell.  I&rsquo;m loving developing, and excited about continuing to get better.  It&rsquo;s crazy how much I&rsquo;ve learned in just over a month.  Little lessons of win for me are form objects and the active attr gem, Avdi&rsquo;s naught gem, feeling more confident with Factory Girl and testing in general.  I&rsquo;m still developing a workflow that works best for me and learning how to break complex problems down into small, testable, bite-sized problems that I can tackle with a level head even under time-constraints without stress, but I know that will come with time.  For now, I&rsquo;m loving what I do, and can&rsquo;t wait to see where I am a few more months down the road.</p>

<p>One of my goals for the next six months is updating my blog more regularly, so hopefully you&rsquo;ll be hearing from me more often!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before gSchool even started, we found out our friends Sarah and Rod were getting married a few weeks after gSchool graduation.  They live in Santiago, Chile and were getting married down there, so we figured it was the perfect trip to a) see the two of them, since we obviously don&rsquo;t get to see each other very often, and b) take a much needed vacation after six months of non-stop work at gSchool.  Turned out it worked just fine with my eventual job too, since I didn&rsquo;t start until September, and we would be taking off for Chile at the beginning of August.</p>

<p>We flew in to Santiago, and it was really interesting to see the city during our cab ride in.  Like any city, there are upscale areas and less affluent areas, and we saw a lot of everything on our way in.  Besides a lot of houses in the less affluent areas with corrugated roofing, it looked a lot like any American city, except with more graffiti and lots of stray dogs (more on that later).</p>

<p>We ended up staying at a penthouse condo in a really nice area of the city that we found on <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/387159">VRBO</a> that had a great view of the city.
<br><br>

<br><br></p>

<p>We met up with Sarah, Rod, and her family for dinner that first night and got to see the neighborhood where Sarah and Rod live.  We also had the chance to ride the metro in Santiago - it was the cleanest public transit I&rsquo;ve been on in my life, and super easy to use.</p>

<p>The next day was the wedding, which took place at this adorable little restaurant, bakery, and event space, <a href="http://www.kuchenhaus.cl">Kuchen Haus</a>.  It was a beautiful wedding - the official parts were in Spanish, but the vows were done in Spanish and in English, and it was really beautiful to watch and was such a reminder that love has no boundaries.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/sarah_rod_wedding.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>The reception was so much fun.  Lots to eat and drink, tons of dancing, and we learned that one stereotype at least is true - the Chileans were much, MUCH better dancers than any of us gringos.  I&rsquo;m fairly certain that Rod must be able to dislocate his hips at will, because I&rsquo;m not sure how else he was able to bust out some of those moves.</p>

<p>It was also cool to interact more with Rod&rsquo;s family once everyone had a bit to drink and was less shy about the language divide.  There&rsquo;s also this great tradition at Chilean weddings - people like to party to the wee hours, so in the middle of the night, guests are served chicken soup to give them more energy and strength so they can keep going for a few more hours.</p>

<p>The next day we slept in since we were still pretty jet lagged and recovering from the night before, and then explored the city a bit.  The presidential palace, La Moneda, was all blocked off for renovations, so you really couldn&rsquo;t see much of anything.  The surrounding areas reminded me of DC though - pretty dead since it wasn&rsquo;t a weekday, but filled with a lot of businesses that cater to the proximity to the palace.</p>

<p>We just kind of walk down the main boulevard the palace is on for a few miles, and ran into Cerro Santa Lucia, this little hill in the middle of the city that used to be a military fort, but is now decked out with fountains and really beautiful facades.  It&rsquo;s not a huge hill, but it had a great view of the city at sunset - I was really glad we happened to run across it.  It was one of the most beautiful sights in Santiago.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/cerro_santa_lucia.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>The following day we spent with Sarah&rsquo;s family as well as her other gringo friends from Australia going on a winery tour at <a href="http://www.undurraga.cl/undurraga/?lang=en">Vina Undurraga</a>.  Since it was winter there wasn&rsquo;t anything growing, but we still got the tour of everything and the wine tasting.  More than anything it was just nice to spend a low key day with everyone before people started taking off.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/chile_gang.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>The next day we took one of those open air double decker bus tours of Santiago.  It&rsquo;s the middle of winter there in August, but we lucked out - it was in the 60s for the most part during our trip and sunny almost every day, so it wasn&rsquo;t uncomfortable to spend the whole day outside in just a sweater.  The bus tour was all right, and we got off at certain points to walk around and explore.  Anyone trying to get tourists into their shops or restaurants had a field day harrassing us.  It&rsquo;s pretty damned obvious with my blonde hair I&rsquo;m not from there, so we cut our exploring around the central market a bit short.</p>

<p>We spent the next few days in Valparaiso, Chile with Sarah and Rod, who decided to postpone their honeymoon and didn&rsquo;t mind spending their post-wedding vacation time with us.</p>

<p>Valparaiso is absolutely gorgeous.  Santiago may be the biggest city and the commercial power in Chile, but Valpo has the soul.  It&rsquo;s right on the ocean, and the city is built on huge hills, so the city is full of beautiful views and winding streets.  A lot of the houses are brightly colored, so it&rsquo;s visually stunning to look at.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/valpo.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>Exploring Valpo at night was a lot of fun.  There&rsquo;s little commercial strips tucked here and there in neighborhoods up in the hills, away from the main part of the city closer to the water.  I wish I remembered the name of the restaurant, but we ate dinner our first night at a pizza place, and it was literally the best pizza I&rsquo;ve had in my life.  I say this as someone who has had Chicago pizza from some of the best places now - still doesn&rsquo;t come close to this little place in Valpo.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting in Chile - people tend to eat really late at night, so we ended up taking a nap at 5 or 6 a few days, sleeping a few hours, and then going out to get dinner.  It was actually quite refreshing, and we had a second wind to explore the city a bit and see it in a different way.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/valpo_street.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>One thing about Valpo is there&rsquo;s street art literally everywhere, of all different kinds.  One of the guys in my gSchool class created an app to track street art for his individual project, and he would have had a field day in Valpo.  To me, the street art we saw was a major component in what made the city so charming.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/valpo_street_art.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>We had to see Pablo Neruda&rsquo;s Valparaiso house, La Sebastiana, while we were in Valpo, and it was gorgeous inside and out.  Even if you don&rsquo;t know Neruda&rsquo;s work, see his house if you&rsquo;re ever in Valparaiso - so beautiful and it makes you feel creative and alive just walking through it.  Don&rsquo;t skip the audio tour in English.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/la_sebastiana.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>The most unique form of transport in Valparaiso is the funicular.  Since the city is so hilly (to the point there were a few streets we could not get up in a car with four people plus luggage) and with so many winding streets, they built these little railway elevator things in the late 19th century that are still in use today.  It&rsquo;s a great way to get around, and as for me, I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about the Motorcycle Diaries every time I rode in one.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/funicular.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>The rest of our stay in Santiago, we just took in the city.  We visited an old prison in the city that was notorious under Pinochet, that has since been turned into a museum and cultural center, with lots of meeting space for classes and events.  It struck me simultaneously as slightly creepy, but also a way to help the community heal, and turn what was an awful place with deplorable conditions into a place the community can gather to take cooking classes and ballet lessons - it&rsquo;s a way to move on.  We also got to see the college Rod went to, which is absolutely gorgeous, and took a boat tour on the harbor to get some amazing views of the city.</p>

<p>I was really sad to leave Valpo.  The atmosphere is relaxed, the people so nice, the city so beautiful, the food so good - I was tempted to stay there on a permanent vacation, but I&rsquo;ll settle for going back one day for a longer stay.</p>

<p>We spent our last day in Chile with Sarah and Rod in Santiago before heading back to the airport.  We went up to Cerro San Cristobal, this massive hill that&rsquo;s in the middle of the city, for a better view and to take one last look around before we left.  It&rsquo;s beautiful from up there, but it was a bit smoggy that day and my camera isn&rsquo;t that great.  Below is a professional picture of Santiago right after a rain, so the smog was cleared up.  It really is a beautiful city with the Andes in the background.
<br><br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/santiago.jpg">
<br><br></p>

<p>And then it was back to the airport, and back to real life :(
<br><br><br>
Just some general thoughts on Chile:</p>

<ul>
<li>So, I mentioned at the beginning of this post the stray dogs.  They are EVERYWHERE in Chile.  At first I didn&rsquo;t get it - there had been a bunch of islands in the Caribbean where there were stray dogs, but it was pretty clear there that people didn&rsquo;t have money to spay or neuter.  Chile is a wealthy country.  The dogs in the islands were also scrawny with obvious health issues.  In Chile, they looked well fed and well taken care of - there were a bunch that even had sweaters on for the winter.  Turns out, it&rsquo;s a cultural thing - from what I was told, Chileans believe it is against God&rsquo;s will to spay or neuter a dog.  They were put on this earth to reproduce, so that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going to let them do.  I saw plenty of people putting food out for the dogs, so at least if people hold this attitude, they&rsquo;re taking care of them.</li>
</ul>


<p>It was really sad for me though, because these were still dogs - they wanted love just as much as my puppy.  They still knew if you looked them in the eye, they might get some food or love out of you, so they&rsquo;d walk over with their ears down and their tail wagging.  I had a really hard time with this, and against everyone&rsquo;s advice, I couldn&rsquo;t help petting the dogs.  Even strays need love.
<br>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdrummond.com/images/street_dog_valpo.jpg">
<br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>People in Chile are super nice.  Everywhere we went, even if people didn&rsquo;t speak English well, they went out of their way to be helpful and kind.  This wasn&rsquo;t just people in the service industry, but people we met everywhere.  I&rsquo;d honestly say it rivaled New Zealand for friendliness.</p></li>
<li><p>The food in Chile is phenomenal.  Everywhere we went, it was fantastic, whether it was Chilean food or ethnic food (who knew Chile had such good Lebanese?).  They love their sandwiches, meat, and seafood, but I think one of the things I enjoyed the most was the most simple - mashed up avocado on toast.</p></li>
<li><p>Chilean drivers are crazy.</p></li>
<li><p>Every time I travel, I can&rsquo;t help but think of stereotypes, and how wrong they tend to be.  On this trip, I thought a lot about the typical American view of all of Latin America as poor, dangerous, and filled with drug smugglers.  Sarah even mentioned a close friend warned her to be careful of the drugs when she moved to Chile.  I can&rsquo;t get over how some Americans don&rsquo;t realize how diverse Latin America is, and differentiate the countries.  Chile is the most advanced, wealthy country in Latin America with a human development index in the same range as the United States.  Seeing different parts of the country, it was hard to think of it as very exotic at times given Santiago especially looked in many neighborhoods like any large city in North America or Europe.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There were parts of the city that looked pretty rundown, and whenever I visit another country that Americans stereotype as poor, it makes me think Oh, this is what they&rsquo;re thinking of when they visualize this place.  Which then just makes me think of all the parts of America that wealthy Americans are so good at forgetting about, the poor areas that they never see and the people they consciously forget about as much as possible.</p>

<p>Never let a stereotype stop you from traveling somewhere.  Look into it, do your research - chances are your assumptions were incorrect and you&rsquo;d be missing out on an amazing experience.
<br><br></p>

<p>So, to sign off - bye, Rod and Sarah.  We had a great time, and I hope we get to see you again soon!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know this is a little late, but better late than never, right?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people I need to thank for their help in supporting me throughout gSchool.  Without their help, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been as rewarding an experience for me; without some of their help, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do it at all.  A huge thank you to everyone listed here, and to a hundred others who helped me along the way.</p>

<ul>
<li>First off, to <a href="http://twitter.com/verdi_michael">Michael Verdi</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/wengzilla">Ed Weng</a> of LivingSocial, for holding the intro to programming workshop that kicked my entire adventure off.  If it hadn&rsquo;t been for their workshop, I would have never realized a) that I could do this and b) how fulfilling it is.</li>
<li>There were a lot of people who helped me out when I got stressed, but <a href="http://twitter.com/edatrix">Lauren Spath Luhring</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/aimzatron">Aimee Maher</a> were the two people who were there closest to me through the most stressful times and put a smile back on my face.  Thanks, ladies!</li>
<li>All of the other <a href="http://people.jumpstartlab.com">gSchool students</a> deserve a big thanks too.  Everyone brought something valuable to the table, and everyone was so helpful - there was a genuine feeling of teamwork throughout the class, and I never felt like anyone was trying to stand up taller by standing on someone else.  I learned so much from all my classmates and hope I helped them learn, too.</li>
<li>Of course, the fabulous <a href="http://jumpstartlab.com/team">gSchool instructors</a> were, well, fabulous throughout the course.  One of the reasons I chose gSchool was because of the quality of the instructors, and they didn&rsquo;t let me down.  They knew their shit, were great at teaching the full group, and were also great at providing one on one help and advice.  <a href="http://twitter.com/kytrinyx">Katrina</a>, especially, took the time to give me a lot of one on one help and also made sure I knew she believed in me, letting me know what I was doing great at and what I needed to work on.  I really appreciate the time they all put into all of us students.</li>
<li>My first mentor, <a href="http://twitter.com/decoydrone">Jim Denton</a>, was amazing.  He was the one who really pushed me and taught me the value of testing by pointing out all the unnecessary headaches I was causing myself.  I really appreciated all the time he spent with me, sometimes an entire afternoon, whipping me into shape and showing me a new way of thinking.</li>
<li>A huge thank you also to my second mentor, <a href="http://twitter.com/tundal45">Ashish Dixit</a>.  Ashish has had awesome ideas for how to refactor some of my gnarliest code, and also introduced me to Table XI - something I can&rsquo;t thank him for enough.  More than that, he&rsquo;s helped point me in the right direction with my jitters on starting my first programming job, and has offered to continue to be my mentor post-gSchool (which is awesome since we&rsquo;ll both be in Chicago!).  He is amazingly smart, so open to helping, and really excited about the broader Ruby community - I feel so lucky to have been teamed up with him.</li>
<li>More than anyone else though, my biggest thanks go out to my wonderful husband, <a href="http://twitter.com/brock">Brock</a>.  I quite literally could not have done this without his support, and support me he did.  He was so excited for me when I decided I wanted to become a programmer, and didn&rsquo;t mind relocating with me to Denver.  Throughout the course he has done most of the housework and took care of the dog when I was studying all the time and helped me out with programming questions throughout the course whenever he could.  He was also so emotionally supportive when I was frustrated, stressed, and drained, and is relocating with me all over again to Chicago without complaint.  I don&rsquo;t know how I got so lucky to have him.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&rsquo;t been updating this as much as I should be, but wanted to post an update on my last month of gSchool and what&rsquo;s been going on since it&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p>My last month of gSchool was pretty hectic with job searching.  I really wanted to take my time to interview with a variety of companies, and find the place that was the best fit for my top two priorities: firstly, I wanted to find a place that was a good fit for me culturally, where I liked the people I was working with, and looked forward to coming in and working with them every day, and where their values were consistent with my own.  Secondly, it was imperative that I work with a company where I could continue to learn, and that would nurture my ongoing learning process.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to just take the first thing that came along, so I really took the time to get to know a number of companies to find the best one for me.  This meant a lot of phone interviews, skype interviews, in person interviews, and take home coding challenges.  I felt pretty bad, because given how busy I was with the interview process, I wasn&rsquo;t able to put in the time that I wanted to on my group projects.  Everyone understood though; everyone else was doing the same.</p>

<p>At the end of it, I came away with three job offers from wonderful companies, any of which I could see myself enjoying culturally, and where I would learn a ton from awesome co-workers and interesting projects.  It was especially difficult as the offers were all from my top three cities - Chicago, Portland, and Denver.  In the end, I decided to accept the offer as a software developer with <a href="http://www.tablexi.com">Table XI</a> in Chicago, for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I love Chicago.  It&rsquo;s an amazing city, with a ton to do.  I&rsquo;ve always considered myself a city person, and I am really excited to get back to a large city with a ton of cultural options, great public transit, people from all over the world - all in America&rsquo;s third largest city.  It helps a lot too that even though it&rsquo;s a huge city, it&rsquo;s still the Midwest, so people are incredibly nice there.  Also the cost of living, especially compared to DC, is great.  Also I have a bunch of friends from college there.  Also the food there is incredible.  Really, just a lot of alsos.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m back within driving distance of my family, which I haven&rsquo;t been since college.  Speaking of college, I&rsquo;m also within driving distance of East Lansing, so I can go back home and catch some Spartan football and basketball games!  Go Green!</li>
<li>Most importantly, I felt that Table XI was the very best fit for me personally.  There are so many things that I love about them, and throughout the interview process, there were a hundred little moments where I just knew this was where I was supposed to be.  The people are all amazingly smart, excited about the work they&rsquo;re doing, happy to help, and yet humble and super nice.  It&rsquo;s a consultancy, so there&rsquo;s a bunch of different projects they get to work on.  They do a lot of work with community groups and non-profits, which is a great fit for my social relations background - even though I&rsquo;m not saving the world full time anymore, it&rsquo;s still one of my values.  The people stay there long term because they genuinely love working there.  There&rsquo;s about ten more pages worth of things I could say about how great Table XI is, but long story short - I&rsquo;m unbelievably excited to start working there and am so thankful I have this opportunity.</li>
</ul>


<p>The actual end of gSchool has been bittersweet.  On one hand, I&rsquo;m happy the madness is over and excited to be moving on to my new job, but on the other, I really miss working with all my classmates - they were amazing people and I made some good friends there.  We had a big party the last day, both at Galvanize and later on at Chris&rsquo;s house, and it was so good to let everything out and spend one last (quite memorable) night with everyone, but I also realized this is likely the last time we were all going to be together.</p>

<p>Since gSchool ended, it&rsquo;s still been a whirlwind.  We started looking into relocating to Chicago, I flew out to Chicago to find an apartment (success!  We&rsquo;ll be living in West Lakeview), we visited our friends in Chile (separate post forthcoming), and now I&rsquo;m trying to cram in all the Denver things I didn&rsquo;t have time to do during gSchool, and meeting up with all my friends here one last time before I leave.  On top of that, I need to pick my sister&rsquo;s New Leaf Massage site back up, and have some books I want to read before starting with Table XI, so this is definitely not a lazy vacation for me!  I did get some reprieve on New Leaf though - my sister just found out she&rsquo;s relocating to Phoenix for her husband&rsquo;s job, and it takes about six months to get set up as a massage therapist in the state, so I&rsquo;m hoping to have everything ready to go by that time.</p>

<p>So - crazy and exciting times, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to this next chapter!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s difficult to describe this as the &lsquo;wrap-up&rsquo; to my project, because there is still a ton of work that I am going to do to it.  I have a pretty massive list at home of all the things I&rsquo;m planning on tweaking, adding, removing, optimizing, addressing - ALL THE INGs.  Still, at the end of the formal project portion of this undertaking, I&rsquo;m pretty proud of my work.  There&rsquo;s things I&rsquo;d do differently and a lot I want to make better, but I am really proud that I was able to do this on my own (with some help from instructors and Brock, especially for the Javascript portion) given I&rsquo;ve only been developing for four and a half months.</p>

<p>I knew this project was going to be tough, and the two toughest things for me were dealing with the Javascript, and correctly figuring out the logic for the open time slots on any given day for a given appointment duration the client was requesting.  If the time slots were all one hour long and started on the hour, it would have been easy peasy, but the appointments could be 60 or 90 minutes, and started every half hour.  The final code needs refactoring, but I tested the shit out of it with a context for every contingency of appointment variation, so I know the logic is sound even if the code needs clean up.  This will be especially helpful when I work on Meghan&rsquo;s final site - she actually has appointment times ranging from 30 to 90 minutes with 15 minute increments, and her hours vary by day, with a few days having large gaps in the afternoon.  Now that I know what I&rsquo;m doing, I&rsquo;m confident I&rsquo;ll be able to make these changes for the final product.</p>

<p>One thing I am wondering how to do is make the calendar more flexible.  Right now, I have the days she&rsquo;s off completely blocked out of the calendar; if she decides to open on a random Saturday, I&rsquo;d like for her to be able to do this without me touching the Javascript that controls which days are blocked out in the calendar.  This is something I&rsquo;d like to talk to my mentor about going forward, but it&rsquo;s an interesting problem to solve and I&rsquo;m excited about it.</p>

<p>It was also really cool to see Meghan&rsquo;s reaction when I showed her the final first version of her site.  She was really excited and loves it, which is good since this is the first, first, baby step skeleton version of what her site will eventually be able to do and how it will look - for final roll out, I&rsquo;m planning on engaging the services of Kyle for a few hours to get the design looking good.  I realize my design skills are not very good right now, and I want to give her an actual professional product.</p>

<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m proud of the work I&rsquo;ve done, both with the site and in general with everything I&rsquo;ve learned in the past few months.  There&rsquo;s still a ton to learn and to do with Meghan&rsquo;s site, but this was a solid first iteration and really helped me to realize my own skills as a developer.</p>

<p>Her site can be seen here: <a href="http://www.newleafmassage.net">newleafmassage.net</a></p>

<p>Look for exciting updates once gSchool is complete and I have the time to finish this up!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My feelings upon starting the individual project were a mixture of excitement and nervousness, weighted towards the former.  It was scary to think though - I was hoping through this project, I&rsquo;d realize I know more than I think I do, but was nervous the opposite would turn out to be true.  I can happily report that, so far, I&rsquo;m feeling my knowledge is right about where I thought it was.  I&rsquo;m not the world&rsquo;s greatest gift to programming, but I&rsquo;m certainly not awful either.</p>

<p>So far, it&rsquo;s been a little bit slow.  I&rsquo;ve managed to get to the point where an admin can sign in, search for a client, and create an appointment for the client.  Once the appointment is created, they get a text via Twilio.  This sounds like a lot, but was actually really simple, and I&rsquo;m working on the hard part now - the logic for time slots and determining which time slots are taken, which are free, and which of the free ones have enough time in them to schedule appointments (if it&rsquo;s a thirty minute timeslot, nothing can be scheduled; if it&rsquo;s a sixty minute timeslot, only the sixty minute massage should show up as an option).</p>

<p>I think once this part is complete, the rest of the MVP will fall into place pretty easily - this is what most of the difficult logic rests upon in the app.  I owe Katrina a huge shout out for her help yesterday.  She helped me to think through how to structure this logic (we have a DayPlanner class, a TimeSlot class, and a Clock class - the last one is because we don&rsquo;t care about the date for a timeslot or dayplanner; only the time), and it would have been a lot messier without her guidance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also really wanting to use AJAX for some of the implementation on the front end.  I&rsquo;d love for the admin appointment scheduling to be on one page - admin searches for a client; once client is selected, the date picker pops up; once date is selected, time picker pops up; once time is selected, massage duration selection pops up with appropriate options given the duration of the available time slot.  I really don&rsquo;t know how to do this, so I&rsquo;m hoping I can get some help from my new mentor.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I&rsquo;m really excited to be working with Ashish - just from our email conversations so far, he seems awesome.  We&rsquo;re doing a get to know you call on Sunday, so I&rsquo;ll find out more then, but I&rsquo;m excited.</p>

<p>I also am really grateful for the help Jim gave me in the previous mentoring rotation.  He was really great to work with and provided me with great feedback when I was starting to go down paths that didn&rsquo;t make a whole lot of sense in my code.</p>

<p>It is crazy to think there&rsquo;s only seven weeks left.  This has felt like a really long four plus months so far, and at times when the stress level was off the charts it felt like the end of the program was eons away.  Now that I&rsquo;m nearing the end, it&rsquo;s a weird feeling.  I&rsquo;m excited with everything I&rsquo;ve learned so far, and excited to start a new job, but it just feels kind of weird that we&rsquo;re already almost done not that we&rsquo;re at the end.</p>

<p>It is an interesting thing to look back though at where I was a few months ago.  Coming in, I had no clue what I was doing, and for the longest time didn&rsquo;t feel like a real developer.  Now, I&rsquo;m beginning to feel like I can say with confidence that yes, I am a developer.  I can take a problem, and find a way to implement a real solution.  I still have a lot to learn with new styles and refactoring and need help from teammates, mentors, or instructors, but that&rsquo;s not really any different from where most real developers are in real life - most developers work on teams and get advice and feedback from others too.</p>

<p>I still do have to pinch myself to think how far I&rsquo;ve come in just 18 weeks though - this feeling is incredible and I&rsquo;m so glad I made the leap to restart my life as a developer.  It hasn&rsquo;t been easy by any means, but it&rsquo;s sure been rewarding and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what I&rsquo;ll be doing next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ah - FeedEngine is in the books.  For some reason, this was a difficult project to get through, even though I loved what we were building.  It seems like we&rsquo;ve reached a point in the class where a lot of people are feeling burned out, and I think that impacted some of our team this project - we ended up dropping a lot of the functionality that I wanted to implement because we couldn&rsquo;t get through it all with the amount of work the group as a whole was putting in.</p>

<p>At the same time, I learned a lot from this project.  The two things I&rsquo;m happiest learning about are how to interact with external APIs (Kyle and I implemented the Instagram service, and I implemented the Foursquare service), and refactoring my code to extract logic from the views and controllers, and even the model.  For this, I have to thank Raphael.</p>

<p>An example of refactoring can be seen in our implementation of the logic relating to the user show page.  For this page, we needed to break a user&rsquo;s trips out into current trips, past trips, and upcoming trips, AND we needed to determine whether the trip was private AND we needed to determine, if the trip was private, if the current viewer was authorized to view the trip.  Sounds easy, right?  I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to be that horribly difficult, but it ended up being harder than I thought to implement all of this logic in one place.</p>

<p>The way I originally wrote this part of the code, I had current, past, and upcoming trips in the Trip model, and handled the logic for whether the current user could view each trip in the controller.  Raph put a stop to that.  We ended up extracting all of this logic into a UserShow class, which took in the current user and the user whose profile was being viewed, ran through each trip to see if it was private and if the current user had viewing rights, and then split the trips into their correct timeframe.  You can view the final implementation here: <a href="https://github.com/raphweiner/feed_engine/blob/master/app/lib/user_show.rb">github.com/raphweiner/feed_engine/blob/master/app/lib/user_show.rb</a></p>

<p>I also learned to place even more value on communicating with your team, especially when you&rsquo;re touching someone else&rsquo;s code.  There were a number of times that I pulled down master to build on code I had previously implemented, and found it had been refactored so much that I had to spend half an hour just figuring out what the heck it was now doing.  Worse, there were times files I had been working on were deleted or the refactoring broke the code I had originally written.  This was pretty frustrating for me, and I&rsquo;m even more aware now that if you&rsquo;re touching someone else&rsquo;s code, it&rsquo;s a great idea to work with them first.</p>

<p>Overall, I think our project is a good first step, but I wish it went further.  There&rsquo;s a lot more functionality I would like to build out and changes I&rsquo;d like to made to the front end to make it look sleeker as well.  I&rsquo;d link to the project, but Jeff is turning off the extra background workers he had provisioned, so the app will no longer work.  I&rsquo;m taking some time off between graduating gSchool and starting a job, so one thing I&rsquo;d love to do is to keep working on Kreepr and get it to a place I&rsquo;m happier with, with more features, more security and background logic, and a cleaner look.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also really excited to be starting our independent project next week.  I don&rsquo;t have 100% sign off yet, but I had talked to Katrina about my idea, and it sounds like I&rsquo;ll be able to do PART of it - my original idea is too large a project to do independently in 9 days.  What I&rsquo;m going to be doing is making a website for my sister, who is a massage therapist.  Once it&rsquo;s completely done, I&rsquo;d like to have functionality to let Meghan set her schedule with a base weekly schedule that autogenerates up to two months out, with the ability to go in and tweak individual days.  In addition to a confirmation e-mail when an appointment is scheduled and a reminder e-mail a day or two out, I&rsquo;d also like to implement text messaging a few hours before an appointment to remind the customer, and let them text back if they need to cancel the appointment.  I&rsquo;d like to integrate with Yelp to show her overall review count, and maybe recent reviews.  Lastly, I&rsquo;d like the ability to allow customers to pre-pay for individual massages or massage packages online, and allow Meghan to charge a cancellation fee for missed appointments.</p>

<p>One of the requirements for this project is to build an API and gem on our own, which I think fits in nicely with the scheduling component.  There are a few other gems out there that I found, but none of them have been maintained in the past year; I&rsquo;d also love if my gem would give back to the community so that other people can use it for their own projects as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to be doing this project, for a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>I think the building out the scheduling component will be a pretty difficult, and it&rsquo;s a challenge that I think will be extremely rewarding.</li>
<li>I really want to give this gift to my sister.  Not only is she basically one of the most wonderful, caring, compassionate people on the planet and I want to help her grow her business, she also hooks me up with free massages.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m really glad to be doing this project while I&rsquo;m in gSchool.  Since this is a site that will actually be used, security is a big concern and I want to be sure that everything is locked down.  It will be really good to have that second set of eyes from my instructors so they can let me know if there are any vulnerabilities that I overlooked.</li>
</ol>


<p>So, super excited to get cracking on that, but also, not going to lie - I&rsquo;m excited about the long weekend too!</p>
